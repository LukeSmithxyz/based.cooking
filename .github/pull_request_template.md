- [ ] I am adding or changing a recipe and I understand and agree to the below
  statements:
    - [ ] My pull request may be closed without reason or notice if:
        - My PR does not conform to all of these rules,
        - I have left one or more of these rules unchecked, or
        - This checklist is missing from my PR.
    - [ ] My recipe is a `.md` file in the `src/` directory (refer to existing
      recipe files or the [example](example.md)).
    - [ ] The filename for my recipe is:
        - The name of the dish,
        - Written in all lowercase, and
        - Each word is separated by a hyphen (`-`)
            - Good: `chicken-tacos.md`
            - bad: `Chicken-Tacos.md` (has capital letters)
            - bad: `chicken tacos.md` (uses spaces)
            - bad: `chicken_tacos.md` (uses underscores)
            - bad: `my-first-recipe.md` (does not describe what the recipe is for)
    - [ ] My recipe is based, i.e. good traditional and substantial food.
      Nothing ironic, meme-tier hyper-sugary, meat-substitute, etc.
        - Meat substitutes are fine if they are not being used for the purpose
          of replacing meat. ie if your recipe is a traditional recipe that uses
          tofu then this is fine.
    - [ ] My recipe contains 2 to 5 relevant tags at the bottom of the recipe
      file. Try to use already existing tags.
    - [ ] My recipe doesn't include salt and pepper and other ubiquitous things
      in the ingredients list.
