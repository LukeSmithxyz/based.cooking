<!--
- Recipes should be `.md` files in the `src/` directory.  Look at already
  existing `.md` files for examples or see [example](example.md).
- File names should be the name of the dish with words separated by hyphens
  (`-`). Not underscores, and definitely not spaces.
- Recipe must be based, i.e. good traditional and substantial food. Nothing
  ironic, meme-tier hyper-sugary, meat-substitute, etc.
- Be sure to add a small number of relevant  tags to your recipe (and remove
  the dummy tags). Try to use already existing tags.
- Don't include salt and pepper and other ubiquitous things in the ingredients
  list.
