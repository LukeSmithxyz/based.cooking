### Ensure that

- Recipes should be `.md` files placed into the `src/` directory. Look at already existing `.md` files for examples or see the [example template](example.md).
- File names should be the name of the dish with any spaced words separated by hyphens.
  - ✅ `dish-name.md`
  - ❌ `dish_name.md`
  - ❌ `dish name.md`
- Be sure to add a small number of relevant  tags to your recipe (and remove the dummy tags). Try to use already existing tags.
  - ✅ `;tags: side american`
  - ❌ `;tags: tag1 tag2 tag3`
  - ❌ `;tags: tag1 tag2 tag3 side american`
  - ❌ `;tags: side, american`
  
- Don't include common items like salt and pepper and other ubiquitous things in the ingredients
  list.
