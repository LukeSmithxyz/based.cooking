# Based Cooking Website

[https://based.cooking](https://based.cooking)

This is a simple cooking website where users can submit recipes here for credit.
There are no ads, trackers, cookies (unless recipes thereof) or javascript.

## Ways to contribute

- By adding a recipe.
- Make a recipe and take a nice picture of it if no nice picture already
  exists. Submitted images should be small `.webp` files ideally less than 100K
  or so.
- Fix errors in recipes or add minor improvements.

## Rules

See [the rules](RULES.md).

**If you fail to do these things, I will close your submission and you will have to resubmit.
I am tired of having to fix more than 50% of submissions.**

## About the site

The front page, for now, will just be a list of recipes automatically generated
from the content of `src`.
As more articles are added, the site will be reorganized, categorized
or will implement server-side scripting or searches.
This is not necessary yet though.

I don't really want images of recipes on the mainpage yet.
I'll think about how best to do it to minimize bandwidth if possible.

## License

This website and all its content is in the public domain.
By submitting text or images or anything else to this repository,
you waive any pretense of ownership to it,
although you are welcome and recommended to give yourself credit
at the bottom of a submitted page for you adding it
(including personal or donation links).
