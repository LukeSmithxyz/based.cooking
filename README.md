# Based Cooking Website

[https://based.cooking](https://based.cooking)

This is a simple cooking website where users can submit recipes here for credit.
There are no ads, trackers, cookies (unless recipes thereof) or javascript.

## Ways to contribute

- By adding a recipe.
- Make a recipe and take a nice picture of it if no nice picture already
  exists. Submitted images should be small `.webp` files ideally less than 100K
  or so.
- Fix errors in recipes or add minor improvements.

## Rules for submission

- Model submission files after [example.md](example.md). Put them in `src/`.
- Recipes should start with a title, with a single `#`, *on the first line*. No
  empty line at the top, not trailing line at the end. The file needs to be `\n`
  terminated in linux-fashion (if you're on linux you don't need to care, it
  should be automatic).
- File names should be the name of the dish with words separated by hyphens
  (`-`). Not underscores, and definitely not spaces.
- Recipe must be based, i.e. good traditional and substantial food. Nothing
  ironic, meme-tier hyper-sugary, meat-substitute, etc.
- Don't include salt and pepper and other ubiquitous things in the ingredients
  list.

**If you fail to do these things, I will close your submission and you will have to resubmit. I am tired of having to fix more than 50% of submissions.**

### Tags

You can (and should) add tags at the end of your recipe. The syntax is:
```
;tags: tag1 tag2 tag3
```

The tag line should be a single line, at the end of the markdown file, preceded
by a blank line.

Add between 1 and 4 tags, **prioritize existing tags**. As a general guideline,
add the country from which the recipe originates if the recipe is representative
of said country, using the adjective form (eg. *mexican*, *italian*, etc). Tag
the main ingredient if it's something slightly special.

List of special, categorical tags to use if relevant:
- `basic`: for basic recipes that aren't meant to be stand alone but are supposed
  to be incorporated in another recipe.
- `breakfast`
- `dessert`
- `drink`
- `quick`: for recipes that can be cooked in under ~20 minutes.
- `side`: side dishes such as mash, fries, etc.
- `snack`
- `spread`

### Images

Images are stored in `data/pix`.

Each recipe can have a title image at the top and perhaps
several instructional images as absolutely necessary.

Do not add stock images you found on the internet.
Take a good picture yourself of the actual dish created.
If you see a bad or substandard image, you may submit a better one.

Images should be in `.webp` format and with as small file size as possible.
If you submit an image for say, `chicken-parmesan.md`, it should be added as `pix/chicken-parmesan.webp`.

If you would like to add additional directional images,
they should be numbered with two digits like: `pix/chicken-parmesan-01.webp`, etc.

## About the site

The front page, for now, will just be a list of recipes automatically generated
from the content of `src`.
As more articles are added, the site will be reorganized, categorized
or will implement server-side scripting or searches.
This is not necessary yet though.

I don't really want images of recipes on the mainpage yet.
I'll think about how best to do it to minimize bandwidth if possible.
