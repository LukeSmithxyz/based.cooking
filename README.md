# Based Cooking Website

[https://based.cooking](https://based.cooking)

This is a simple cooking website where users can submit recipes here for credit.
There are no ads, trackers, cookies (unless recipes thereof) or javascript.

## Ways to contribute

- By adding a recipe.
- Make a recipe and take a nice picture of it if no nice picture already
  exists. Submitted images should be small `.webp` files ideally less than 100K
  or so.
- Fix errors in recipes or add minor improvements.

## Rules and license

See [the rules](RULES.md).

**If you fail to do these things, I will close your submission and you will have to resubmit.
I am tired of having to fix more than 50% of submissions.**

## About the site

The front page, for now, will just be a list of recipes automatically generated
from the content of `src`.
As more articles are added, the site will be reorganized, categorized
or will implement server-side scripting or searches.
This is not necessary yet though.

I don't really want images of recipes on the mainpage yet.
I'll think about how best to do it to minimize bandwidth if possible.
