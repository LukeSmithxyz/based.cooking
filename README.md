# Based Cooking Website

[https://based.cooking](https://based.cooking)

## To-do

- get many recipes
- make and take pictures of recipes
- decide on CSS/styling, something good-looking and readable, but nothing too complicated
- search function? See below
- keep it simple

## Rules for submission

Add reciples as `.md` files to the `src/` directory.
Look at already existing `.md` files for examples
or see [example](example.md).

Recipe must be based, i.e. good traditional and substantial food. Nothing
ironic, meme-tier hyper-sugary, meat-substitute, etc.

### Minor rules

- Don't include salt and pepper and other ubiquitous things in the ingredients list.
- If measurements are used, include metric and American measurements. Do not use decimals in American; round or use fractions.

## Images

Each recipe can have a title image at the top and perhaps
several instructional images as absolutely necessary.

Do not add stock images you found on the internet.
Take a good picture yourself of the actual dish created.
If you see a bad or substandard image, you may submit a better one.

Images should be in `.webp` format.
If you submit an image for say, `chicken-parmesan.md`, it should be added as `pix/chicken-parmesan.webp`.
I will create smaller images from that which is seen on the page,
and upon being clicked, the user will see the full-size image.

If you would like to add additional directional images,
they should be numbered with two digits like: `pix/chicken-parmesan-01.webp`, etc.

## About the site

The front page, for now, will just be a list of recipes
and when adding a `.md` page, please manually add a link to it in the list.
As more articles are added, the site will be reorganized, categorized
or will implement server-side scripting or searches.
This is not necessary yet though.

I don't really want images of recipes on the mainpage yet.
I'll think about how best to do it to minimize bandwidth if possible.

This site is generated with [Roman Zolotarev](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/)'s
[ssg5](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html) which is also included in this
repo for replicability.

## curl/Search function in the future

I eventually want a command-line/curl interface to this site.
Part of this would be an implicit search function.

So suppose someone wants a recipe with chicken, I'd like
`curl based.cooking/chicken` to return articles with that title.
If there is only one result, that page is opened.

Just something to think about.
Then people could make a simple two or three character alias to get a simple text recipe.
