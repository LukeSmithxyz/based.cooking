# Based Rules

## Rationale

These rules are implemented to only allow authentic, traditional, high-quality food.

Make [based.cooking](https://based.cooking) based again!


## Rules

### Bugmanism is banned

Vegan or vegetarian recipes are fine, but specific bugman food imitating authentic food is disallowed.

#### Examples

- soy sausages
- tofu
- mycoprotein meat substitutes

### No soyboys

Soy is banned. For the lulz.

### Autuentic, traditional, high-quality ingredients and dishes

Always include and prefer the name of the authentic, traditional, high-quality ingredients and dishes over the cheaper, lower-quality, mass-produced variety.

#### Examples

- "Parmesan" is the name of a generic cheese which is cheaper, mass-produced, and of lower-quality than its genuine counterpart.
The authentic, traditional cheese is called Parmigiano-Reggiano and is a protected term used to designate high-quality cheese made in a specific region of Italy.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigiano-Reggiano for more details.
This rule was instated because there used to be a parasitic prevalence and preponderance of "parmesan" on [based.cooking](https://based.cooking).
- "Parma ham" is an anglicisation of "prosciutto".
The most famous type of authentic prosciutto is probably prosciutto crudo di Parma.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto for more details.
