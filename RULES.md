# Based Rules

## Rationale

These rules are implemented to ensure:
- the repository stays neat and tidy,
- a consistent Markdown style amongst all recipes,
- consistent technical details like file format and file names amongst all recipes,
- recipes are not condescending or verbose, and
- only authentic, traditional, high-quality food.

Make [based.cooking](https://based.cooking) based again!


## Rules

### Recipe format

Model submission files after [example.md](example.md), then put them in `src/`.

### Markdown style

Recipes should start with a title, with a single `#` *on the first line*.

### Technichal details

- Redipes should start with no empty line at the top and end with no trailing lines.
- There should be no trailing whitespace.
- The file needs to be `\n` terminated in Unix-like fashion (if you're using a Unix-like system, it should be automatic).
- Encode files in UTF-8.
- File names should be the name of the dish with words separated by hyphens (`-`), not underscores, and definitely not spaces.

### Bugmanism is banned

Vegan or vegetarian recipes are fine, but specific bugman food imitating authentic food is disallowed.

#### Examples

- soy sausages
- tofu
- mycoprotein meat substitutes

### No soyboys

Soy is banned. For the lulz.

### No meme-tier sweet or unhealthy dishes

Only substantial dishes are allowed, no hyper-sugary desserts or junk food.

### Treat your audiance as if they are intelligent

- Do not include ubiquitous ingredients like salt and pepper in the ingredients list.
- Keep your instructions clear and concise.
- Do not waffle on or elaborate in unnecessary ways.

# No life stories

Keep the introduction short.
Nobody cares about the 1000-page lore and backstory of your recipe's cinematic universe.

### Autuentic, traditional, high-quality ingredients and dishes

Always include and prefer the name of the authentic, traditional, high-quality ingredients and dishes over the cheaper, lower-quality, mass-produced variety.

#### Examples

- "Parmesan" is the name of a generic cheese which is cheaper, mass-produced, and of lower-quality than its genuine counterpart.
The authentic, traditional cheese is called Parmigiano-Reggiano and is a protected term used to designate high-quality cheese made in a specific region of Italy.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigiano-Reggiano for more details.
This rule was instated because there used to be a parasitic prevalence and preponderance of "parmesan" on [based.cooking](https://based.cooking).
- "Parma ham" is an anglicisation of "prosciutto".
The most famous type of authentic prosciutto is probably prosciutto crudo di Parma.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto for more details.
