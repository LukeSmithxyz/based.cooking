# Based Rules

## Rationale

These rules are implemented to only allow traditional, authentic, high-quality, based food.

Make [based.cooking](https://based.cooking) based again!


## Rules

- Vegan or vegetarian recipes are fine, but specific bugman food imitating authentic food is disallowed, eg. soy sausages, tofu, mycoprotein meat substitutes.
- Soy is banned. For the lulz.
- "Parmesan" is the name of a cheaper, inauthentic, mass-produced, lower-quality, generic cheese.
The authentic, traditional cheese is called Parmigiano-Reggiano and is a protected term used to designate high-quality cheese made in a specific region of Italy.
See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigiano-Reggiano for more details.
This rule was instated because there used to be a parasitic prevalence and preponderance of "parmesan".
