# Based Rules

## Rationale

These rules are implemented to only allow authentic, traditional, high-quality food.

Make [based.cooking](https://based.cooking) based again!


## Rules

### Bugmanism is banned

Vegan or vegetarian recipes are fine, but specific bugman food imitating authentic food is disallowed.

#### Examples

- soy sausages
- tofu
- mycoprotein meat substitutes

### No soyboys

Soy is banned. For the lulz.

### Autuenticty, traditional, high-quality ingredients and dishes

Always include and prefer the name of the authentic, traditional, high-quality ingredients and dishes over the cheaper, lower-quality, inauthentic, mass-produced variety.

#### Examples

- "Parmesan" is the name of a cheaper, inauthentic, mass-produced, lower-quality, generic cheese.
The authentic, traditional cheese is called Parmigiano-Reggiano and is a protected term used to designate high-quality cheese made in a specific region of Italy.
See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigiano-Reggiano for more details.
This rule was instated because there used to be a parasitic prevalence and preponderance of "parmesan" on [based.cooking](https://based.cooking).
