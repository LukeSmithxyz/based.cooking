## Ingredients

- One block of firm tofu (400g, extra firm will work too)
- 1 head (300 grams stemless) of Broccoli
- 2-4 cloves of garlic, diced
- 1/2 cup light soy sause 
- 1 cup dark soy sause
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar (or any non-balsamic vinegar)
- 1/4 cup vegetable stock (or water)
- 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine or dry cherry (optional)
- 1 tablespoon hoisin sause
- 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2.5 tablespoon peanut oil (any oil will do)
- water
- 50-100g ginger, diced (optional)

## Directions

1. Cut the tofu into 3/4‚Äù (2 cm) cubes and place it in a sealable ziplock bag.
2. Combine 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon dark soy sauce, sugar and rice vinegar ingredients in a bowl and stir to mix. 
3. A food prep rectangular tupperware could work very well, as you need less marinade to submerge the tofu. Add tofu and refrigirate for half an hour.
4. Combine vegetable stock, remaining soy sause, wine, sesame oil, cornstarch and hoisin sause into a bowl and stir until the cornstarch is dissolved.
5. Cut the florets off the stalks of broccoli. Cut into 1cm chunks. Wash and drain if needed. 
6. Heat 1/3 cup of water in a large pan over medium/high heat until boiling. Add broccoli and cover with a lid. Steam for 2-3 minutes depending on how hard you want it, then drain and rinse the remaining water off. Put the broccoli aside.
7. Add 2 tbsp of oil on the same pan. Cook tofu until the bottom is golden brown, flip and repeat. Stir a few times, then move to the side of the pan.
8. Add more oil, garlic, ginger. Stir until it releases fragrance - generally less than a minute, then stir to combine the two.
9. Cook together until sause thickens, then add broccoli and stir to combine.
