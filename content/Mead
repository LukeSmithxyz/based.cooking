This recipe contains instructions for making a simple mead. Any yeast can be used (baking yeasts will yield ~8%), but a champagne yeast will yield the highest alcohol content(~18%). Ingredient proportions can be varied, less honey will produce a drier mead while more honey will produce a sweeter mead that will have a higher alcohol content.

Ingredients

    Water: 1 Gallon
    Honey: 3 Pounds (4 cups)
    Yeast: A pinch
    
Directions

    Day 1: Find a suitable container for brewing your mead. You can buy an airlock online or at a brewing store which allows the container to release pressure without oxygen entering the container. They are pretty cheap. While this is not needed, note that if you use a sealed container and do not relieve the pressure, it can cause your glass bottle to shatter. Mix water, honey and yeast and seal the container.
    
    Day 2-14: Relieve the pressure from your container (if you do not use a brewing airlock). (1 min/day)
    
    Day 15-28: The fermentation process has now completed. The mead can now be bottled and flavors such as fruit can be added if you like. Aging a further 2 weeks will improve the flavor but is not strictly necessary.
