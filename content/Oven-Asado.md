Such a simple way to prepare such a juicy slab of meat- Argentinian style! 

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 10 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 45 min

## Ingredients
- Beef chuck short ribs (bone in preferrably)
- Celusal BBQ Salt - Iodized (including the specific type of salt due to smaller salt grains not working well)

## Directions
1. Heat oven to 400F/200C
2. Take beef out of fridge and let thaw or reach near room temperature
3. [OPTIONAL] Rinse each end of the beef to get rid of any remaining bone fragments from when the meat was cut
4. Pat all sides of beef dry with a paper towel
5. Salt each side of the beef **generously**, salt will drip off of the meat due to the fat as the meat cooks
6. Place beef on a rack and place in oven **bone-side down**
7. 20 minutes into cooking, flip each piece over (should be bone-side top now)
8. After another 20 minutes, flip each piece again
9. Take out of the oven after a total of 40 - 45 minutes, and let rest for 5 - 10 minutes
