[Speculaas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculaas) is a Dutch biscuit popular
in France, where I am from. It adds texture and flavor, but it is not necessary
(you can simply skip the steps dealing with speculaas).

Pick apples you like (I like to mix sweet and sour apples). You may also switch
fruits. For example by using red berries. As the crust preparation remains the
same, you can use this recipe as a template.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 20/30 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 20/30 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 6/8 people

## Ingredients

- 1kg apples
- 200g flour
- 250g brown sugar (200g for the crust, 50g to cook the apples)
- 150g butter (100g for the crust, 50g to cook the apples and butter the
  baking dish; I use sweet butter but you may use salter butter)
- 8/10 spaculaas biscuits
- Cinnamon

## Directions

Before starting, get the butter out of the fridge. This will bring it to room
temperature (softer).

1. Peel the apples and cut them in eight, and again in two along their length.
2. *Cook the apples*. Melt some butter in a large casserole (apples should not
   overlap themselves). Then add: all apples, 50g of brown sugar, and some
   cinnamon. Use medium/high heat; this should take 5/10 min. Take the
   preparation off when the apples are nicely browned and soft.  In the
   meantime, start making the crust (next item).
3. *Prepare the crust*. Put the flour, 200g brown sugar and 100g butter in a
   large bowl. Make the crust by mixing everything by hand. The crust is ready
   once it has a sandy texture. You can always adjust the texture by adding
   butter, flour or sugar.
4. Optionally, take one third of the speculaas, ground them, and add them to
   the crust preparation.
5. Butter your oven dish with the remaining butter. 
6. Optionally, ground the last two thirds of speculaas, and spread them evenly
   in the baking dish.
7. Put the apples in the baking dish. Spread the crust on them. At this point,
   the preparation should look like this:

8. Put the dish in the oven, 200¬∞C (conversion method
   [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Convert-Celsius-(%C2%B0C)-to-Fahrenheit-(%C2%B0F)),
   for 20/30 min. When the crust is homogeneously brown, put it two minutes in
   the oven with the *grill* function (be very careful not to let the crumble
   burn)!

Enjoy your crumble!
