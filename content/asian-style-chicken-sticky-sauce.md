## Ingredients

### Chicken with crispy coating

- Around 14 ounces or 400 grams of chicken breast
- 1 Egg
- 3 tbsp of cornflour
- 10 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp paprika powder
- Around 5 tbsp of sesame oil for frying the chicken

### Sauce

- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 garlic cloves, mashed to paste.
- 1 tbsp Chinese rice vinegar or alternatively white wine vinegar
- 3 tbsp honey
- 2 tbsp ketchup
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 4 tbsp soy sauce

## Directions

1. Prepare the sauce by mixing the ingredients together in a bowl.
2. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.
3. Place all-purpose flour in a shallow bowl. Mix in garlic powder as well as salt and pepper, 1/2 tsp each.
4. Place lightly beaten egg in another shallow bowl.
5. Coat the chicken in corn flour, dip it in egg and finally coat with seasoned all purpose-flour.
6. Heat a good amount of oil on a pan to fry the chicken in. The oil should be hot enough so that the chicken sizzles when placed in the pan. You may want to do this in a couple of batches depending on the size of your pan.
7. Fry until chicken is cooked and has a nice golden-brownish coating.
8. Pour out excess oil, put the sauce in and mix to coat the chicken. Or place the chicken in a bowl with kitchen towels and do another batch.
9. Let the sauce bubble for one or two minutes and you're done.
10. Serve with boiled rice.
