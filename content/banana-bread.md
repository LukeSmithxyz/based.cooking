Not too sweet. Great for when you have friends over for tea.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- Spices:
    - 1 teaspoon cinnamon
    - 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
    - 1/4 teaspoon ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups mashed bananas (this is around 4-5 bananas)
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup sugar (brown or white is fine)
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/4 cup crushed walnuts

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
2. Mix the wet ingredients (eggs, bananas, butter, sugar) in one bowl.
3. Mix the dry ingredients (flour, baking soda/powder, spices, salt) in another
   bowl.
4. Slowly add the wet to the dry while mixing.
5. Mix until dry bits of flour are gone.
6. Pour into lightly buttered or oiled loaf pan.
7. Bake for around an hour (it's definitely ready when a wooden skewer or
   chopstick poked inside comes out clean).
