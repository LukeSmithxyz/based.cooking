Though most people find liver barely tolerable to eat, it is extremely nutritious (the most nutrient dense food in the world!). 
If you really can't stand the taste of it, add more vegetables and lower the amount of liver, as even a very small portion is highly beneficial.

- üç≥ Cook time: 12 min

## Ingredients

- 1 lb Beef Liver
- 1-2 Onions
- 1-2 Carrots, and/or Celery Stalks (optional)
- 250g of Corn and/or Green Peas (optional)

## Directions

1. Heat up the pan to medium with oil / animal fat.
2. Chop up the onions into long pieces or small squares, to your preference.
3. Put onions in pan. Wait a couple minutes, turn the heat to high, and add the liver. Stir frequently to prevent onions from burning. Cook for about 10 minutes.
4. If pieces of beef liver are large, cut them into smaller pieces. About half a finger in size is best. 
5. Add other vegetables. (optional)
6. Season generously with salt and any seasoning you like. Various spice rubs work well.
