Tender chunks of meat in a rich brown gravy poured over sour cream mashed potatoes, made in a pressure cooker. This recipe is a modification of the [Texas Cafe Classics Sirloin Tips Recipe](https://youtu.be/91gAm1hBaT4) by Mark Rippetoe.

## Ingredients

- Any lean, tough cut of meat (ex. round steak)
- Unprocessed animal fat of some kind (ex. beef suet, mutton fat)
- Potatoes
- Sour cream
- Butter
- Milk
- Shredded cheese of your choice
- Small amount of flour
- Beef bouillon (optional)
- Red wine (optional)

## Directions

**Beef Tips in Gravy**

1. Throw your pressure cooker with an open lid onto high heat or turn it onto saute mode if it's electric
2. Chop up the fat into very small, uniform cubes or strips and begin to saute it in the pressure cooker
3. Chop up your meat into medium, uniform cubes or strips and add it to the fat
4. _Optional_: If you are not using red wine as a deglaze in step 7 or are not cooking a large amount (~2+ pounds/~1+ kg) of meat, you may want to add a teaspoon or so of beef bouillon into the pressure cooker to intensify the beef flavor of the gravy
5. Add a generous amount of salt and pepper to taste along with a tiny pinch of garlic powder and stir (be very conservative with the garlic powder)
6. Once the meat is sufficiently browned off and there is a nice glaze forming on the bottom of the cooker, deglaze the cooker using hot water or red wine (optional) for more flavor.
7. Put the top on your pressure cooker and allow the meat to cook for around 30 minutes on low heat while you prepare your mashed potatoes
8. After half an hour, vent your pressure cooker, remove the lid, and put the cooker back on low heat
9. Add a small amount of hot water until the liquid in the cooker is a bit more than the amount of gravy you want, then allow it to come to a boil
10. In a small bowl, mix up some flour with warm water to the consistency of a very runny batter
11. Very slowly begin adding flour water into the pot while constantly stirring until the gravy thickens and reaches the consistency you desire (it's very easy to overthicken the gravy here, don't overdo it!)
12. Turn off the heat and plate on top of your sour cream mashed potatoes, shown below

**Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes**

1. Peel and dice up your potatoes
2. Boil them on medium heat in a pot of slightly salty water until they begin to fall apart when poked with a fork
3. Turn off the heat and pour off the water
4. Mash up the potatoes to the chunkiness you desire
5. While the potatoes are still warm, add a generous amount of butter and shredded cheese and stir
6. Add a very small amount of milk and stir (be conservative here, the sour cream will provide most of the softness of the mash)
7. Begin adding sour cream and thoroughly mixing until the mash reaches your desired consistency
8. Plate under your beef tips in gravy
