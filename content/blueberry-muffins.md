## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup milk
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries

## Directions

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
5. Gently fold in the fresh blueberries.
6. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about three-quarters full.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
8. Remove the muffins from the oven and allow them to cool in the tin for a few minutes.
9. Transfer the muffins to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.

Enjoy your homemade blueberry muffins!
