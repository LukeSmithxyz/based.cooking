This recipe is designed to use up spare bread, so base the other quantities on the amount of bread, and how much liquid it can absorb.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 30 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 1hr 15 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4

## Ingredients
- Bread (Any type, as much as you want to use.)
- At least 600ml (20fl oz) Milk
- 1 Egg 
- Granulated white sugar
- Whole Nutmeg (at least 1 nut)
- ~300g Sultanas (Adjust to your preference)
- 2 Bay Leaves (Optional)
- Almonds (Optional)

## Directions
Preheat the oven to 150C (302F)
1. Soak the sultanas in water until they become more swollen, overnight if you have time.
2. Tear the bread into strips and place in a baking tin
3. Whisk the milk, eggs and sugar to taste, creating a custard. (this is the main way of adding sweetness, so adjust to your liking.)
4. Grate the nutmeg into a bowl (use a cheesegrater. This will take a while but is worth it)
5. (Optional) Crumble the bay leaves into the nutmeg
6. Whisk the spice mixture into the custard mixture, *leaving a small amount spare for sprinkling*
7. Take the sultanas out of the water, and add them to the bread in the baking tin. Mix thoroughly.
8. (Optional) Add the almonds along with the sultanas to the baking tin.
9. Mix the spiced custard into the baking tin. If you have added almonds, make sure they are distributed well.
10. Add the rest of the spice mixture to the top, with some sugar; again to taste.
11. Put in the oven for roughly 1hr 15mins. Poke with a butter knife in the centre once it looks ready. If wet, it is not done.
12. (Optional) Once cool, put in the fridge over night to solidify more; it is more delicious after a day in the fridge.
Enjoy!
