Chicken Paprikash is a delicious meal from Hungary, and I hope you are also Hungary! I make it all the time when I have guests.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 10 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 1 hr 25 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 8

## Ingredients

- 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- salt to taste
- pepper to taste
- 2 cups chicken or beef broth
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 medium sized onions
- 1 tablespoon powdered garlic
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1/4 cup Hungarian paprika or regular paprika
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (optional)
- 1 cup sour cream (optional)

## Directions

1. Pat raw chicken thighs with paper towels and dispose of raw chicken juice. Patting the chicken thighs will allow for a crispier skin. Raw chicken juice is very toxic so wash your hands. Salmonella is not fun at all believe me.

2. Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper while heating up a heavy deep sided pan on high heat with a little olive oil. Place the chicken thighs skin-side down. Brown the thighs for five minutes on each side then remove every thigh and place them on another plate once browned.

3. Add the chopped onions to the pan with the chicken fat and sauce until the onions are golden typically this takes about 5 minutes. Add the powdered garlic and tomato paste. Stir this another 5 minutes to create a tomato-roux. Now it is time to add the most important ingredient: Hungarian paprika. Add the paprika to the tomato-roux and stir another minute. Add the chicken or beef broth and bring it to a medium temperature.

4. Now it is time for the long-cooking phase. Reduce the heat to medium low and transfer the chicken thighs from the plate back into the pan. Be sure not to waste any chicken fat it‚Äôs pure flavor! Cover the pan with a lid and simmer the dish for 45 to 60 minuites. Ensure with a fork that the chicken is tender after simmering. Add salt and pepper to taste after the chicken is done cooking of course.

5. Plate the chicken with an optional dusting of cayenne pepper and serve it with some nice hearty bread. This dish has sour cream added to it traditionally, however if dairy is not your thing it‚Äôs delicious without it also. So for this last step you can add some sour cream to the sauce and stir it or add the sour cream at the end when you plate the chicken. Then garnish with herbs and enjoy!
