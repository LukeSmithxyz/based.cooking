This is a recipe shared to me from a friend. Some folks like it on brownies, but I find most people like it on peanut butter cookie bars. But you can experiment with using it to top various things.

- üç≥ Cook time: ~15 minutes
- üçΩÔ∏è  Servings: one 13"x9" sheet (brownies or cookie bars)

## Ingredients

- 4 ounces semi-sweet baking chocolate
- 4 tbsp of butter
- 1 1/2 cups of confectioner's sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 5 tbsp of hot water

## Directions

1. Start melting the 4 tbsp of butter in a medium saucepan. Once enough melts to where it can act as a buffer for the chocolate, start adding the 4 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate a row at a time. After all of the chocolate is added, stir until both the butter and chocolate are fully melted together.
2. Once chocolate and butter are melted together, take it off the heat and add the 5 tbsp of hot water, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and cup and a half of confectioner's sugar.
3. Give it one final stir before pouring it on the brownies or cookie bars you want it to cover. It takes 3-4 hours to harden enough to cut it easily.
