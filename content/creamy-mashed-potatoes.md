Mashed potatoes is a really great recipe that is often relegated to the position
of side dish. This recipe is a spin of the classical mashed potatoes recipe
that's got itself more going on. You can serve this dish for a relatively light
meal, or you can also serve it as a side dish if you want to have a really
hearty meal.

## Ingredients

The quantities here are for about four adult portions. If you are planning on
eating this as a side dish, it might be more like 6-8 portions.

* 1kg potatoes
* 200ml milk*
* 200ml mayonnaise*
* ~100g cheese
* Garlic powder
* 12-16 strips of bacon
* Butter
* 3-4 green onions
* Black pepper
* Salt

\*You can play with the proportions depending on how creamy or dry you want the
mashed potatoes to be.

## Directions

1. Peel and cut the potatoes into medium sized pieces.
2. Put the potatoes in a pot with some water so that it covers the potatoes and
   boil them for about 20-30 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft.
3. About ten minutes before removing the potatoes from the boiling water, cut
   the bacon into little pieces and fry it.
4. Warm up the milk and mayonnaise.
5. Shred the cheese.
6. When the potatoes are done, remove all water from the pot, add the warm milk
   and mayonnaise mix, add some butter, and mash with a potato masher or a
   blender.
7. Add some salt, black pepper and garlic powder to taste and continue mashing
   the mix.

   add the shredded cheese and fried bacon and mix a little.
