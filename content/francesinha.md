2. Pour the beer and simmer until the alcohol evaporates. It's around 5 minutes.
3. Pour the beef broth, the fried tomato sauce, the port wine, the Piripiri and the butter to give shine to the sauce. Add the cornstarch slowly avoiding lumps. Simmer for a couple of minutes until the sauce looks thick.

6. Cover with the sauce and serve with french fries.
