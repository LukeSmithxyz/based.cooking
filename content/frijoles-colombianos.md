## Ingredients

- 2 lbs. of large kidney beans.
- 3 chicken bouillon cubes Enough water to cover the beans.
- one finely chopped onion.
- one lb bacon, cooked (optional) bean seasoning sachet (optional) one grated carrot.
- one large tomato, peeled, diced.
- two diced green bananas salt and cumin to taste.

## Directions

1. Before preparation, wash the beans and let them soak (covered by water) for about a day to soften. Save the water because it is reused for cooking.
2. The next day, place the beans in the pressure cooker with all the ingredients for about 1 hour.\* If you use a conventional pot, the ideal is to cook for about 3 hours on low heat.
3. Remove from pot and serve.

## Tips.

- For every cup of beans, you will need about two cups of water.
- Serve with fried bacon, white rice, plantains, and even fried eggs.
- I'm not a good cook :).
