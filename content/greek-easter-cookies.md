- üç≥ Cook time: 18-22 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: Five-dozen individual cookies

## Ingredients

- 1 lb of unsalted butter

- 1 pinch of baking soda

- 1 cup warmed milk
- 1 egg yolk whisked to brush cookies

## Directions

1. Cream butter and sugar together until fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time and blend well between each.
2. Add ammonium to the warmed milk and add to the butter, sugar, and egg mixture.
3. Start adding flour to the wet mixture and at this time also add the baking powder, vanilla, lemon/orange zest, salt and orange juice.
4. Mix well and start adding flour slowly until you are able to roll the dough easily between your hands. (This is a big batch, if your mixer can‚Äôt handle the volume, then knead by hand).

6. Line pans with parchment paper.
7. Form dough by hand in ¬Ω inch thick 3 inch long strips and then twist together or any shape you like.  If the dough is sticky dip hands in oil.
8. Brush with beaten egg yolks and bake at 350F for about 20 minutes or 325F convection.  Watch carefully as they can burn easily!
