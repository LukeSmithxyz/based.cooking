This recipe yields a batch of relatively spicy chicken thighs. If you don't like spicy foods, you can add more honey and less sriracha.
Conversely, if you like spicy foods, consider a 1:1 ratio of sriracha and honey.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 5 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 40-45 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4

## Ingredients

* 5-6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/3 cup honey
* 2 tablespoons sriracha hot sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* Sesame seeds as a garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350¬∞F
2. Season the chicken. Rub the thighs with some olive oil and season liberally with salt and pepper.
3. Place the chicken thighs in a cold skillet, skin-side down. Cook for 15 minutes on medium-low heat without touching them.
4. Prepare Sriracha sauce by stirring honey and sriracha together in a bowl.
5. Flip the chicken thighs. Cook for another 10 minutes.
6. Place chicken thighs on baking tray (or just use skillet if using a cast-iron skillet). Drizzle the sriracha sauce on both sides of the chicken, coating it. You do not have to use all of it.
7. Bake chicken thighs for 15 minutes.
8. Test chicken for doneness. Chicken should reach internal temperature of 165¬∞F.
9. If chicken is near done (or done), you can baste a second time with the remaining sauce (you can make more sauce if you need) and return to oven for 5 more minutes. Do not worry about overcooking; chicken thighs are difficult to overcook.
10. When chicken is done, let cool for a few minutes and garnish with sesame seeds before serving.
