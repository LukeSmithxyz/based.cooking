- üç≥ Cook time: 25-30 min

## Ingredients

- 600g or 5 cups bread flour (or all-purpose if not available)
- 1 packet (appr. 2 1/4 tsp or 7g) active dry yeast
- olive oil for greasing

## Directions

1. Follow directions on the packet to activate yeast in a bowl large enough for mixing the dough
2. Add enough water for a total of 400g or 1 3/4 cups (i.e. add 400g minus however much water was used to activate the
   yeast)
3. Optionally add 12g or 2 tsp salt (Unsalted bread is normal in Central Italy, but it's an acquired taste)
4. Slowly mix in flour until it forms a dough that will be easy to work with and not overly sticky. Make sure there are
   no wet or dry pockets in the dough.
5. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
6. Knead the dough and let it rise covered for 1 hour in a warm place until doubled in size.
7. Split the dough in half and shape it into two loaves. Make sure the seams are at the bottom.
8. Place the loaves on a lightly greased baking sheet and let it rise covered for 1 hour in a warm place until doubled
   in size.
9. Make sure the oven is preheated to 200¬∞C (400¬∞F) before the resting period is over.
10. Score the loaves and place the baking sheet in the oven.
11. Bake for 25-30 minutes.
12. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.
