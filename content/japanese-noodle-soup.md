This is a very easy and simple Japanese style ramen noodle soup. This is very cheap to make, and you can really customise this however you wish with the garnish. This is my own spin inspired by other recipes that I found.

2. Bring this to the boil, then turn the heat to low and simmer for around 5 mins.

6. Cook the ramen noodles as per packet instructions.
7. Strain the stock into another pan, then reheat.
8. Divide ramen between 4 bowls, then top with 1 sliced pork chop, 1/4 of the spinach (if applicable) sweetcorn, and one boiled egg (halved).
