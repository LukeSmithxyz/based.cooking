This is one of the three pasta dishes that I usually cook. It's a Russian pasta
recipe that is fast and easy to make and is quite tasty.

## Ingredients

Here are the ingredients for about two hearty adult portions:

* 250g pasta. Usually I prefer to use fusilli or penne, but any short-cut pasta
  should do.
* 300-400g ground beef
* 3-4 tomatoes
* 1 carrot
* 1/2 onion
* 2-3 garlic cloves
* Cumin
* Paprika

## Directions

1. Add olive oil to your frying pan, heat it to medium-high heat.
2. Chop some onions and add them to the preheated pan.
3. After a couple of minutes add the ground beef to the pan, salt it and mix it
   a bit with the onions in the pan.
4. When the meat is almost done, mince the garlic and add it together with the
   cumin and paprika to the pan.
5. [Cook the pasta](/pasta) in a pot until its done al dente while the beef is being
   cooked.
6. Grate the tomatoes over the pan using a grater with small-sized slots, in
   such a way that the tomato paste and juice falls right away from the grater
   to the pan.
7. Grate the carrot using a grater with medium-sized slots and add it to the
   pan.
8. Salt some more to taste, and add some black pepper to taste, mix.
9. Cook it over medium/medium-low heat for about 10-15 minutes or until the
   water and juices from the tomatoes have almost completely evaporated.
10. Once (or if) the pasta and beef is already cooked, add the pasta to the pan
   and cook for another couple of minutes.
11. Serve hot and enjoy!
