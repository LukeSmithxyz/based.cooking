![pate chinois](/pix/pate-chinois.webp "Homemade pate chinois with to much ketchup")

This is the most traditional dish that every household eats in Quebec. As a kid, you would eat P√¢t√© Chinois at least once a week, either at home or at the school's cafeteria,. It is very similar to a Shepherd‚Äôs Pie, as it is divided in 3 layers of ingredients: meat, legumes and mashed potatoes. The literal translation of the name is something like _chinese pie_. You can search for the origin of the name on the internet, I'm not an history teacher.

- This recipe can be easily double and you can also freeze it for lunches.
- If you like mushrooms, you can brown 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms with the onions of the beef layer.
- If you want to be wild, you can swap the corn layer with a mix of diced veges like black radishes, parsnips, carrots, turnips and/or cauliflower.
