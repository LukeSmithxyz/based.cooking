Cornmeal preparation originated in Italy. This is how it is done by Venetian immigrants in Brazil.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: As long as the water takes to boil and you to set all ingredients.
- üç≥ Cook time: 40 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4

## Ingredients

- 1500ml of water
- 1kg of cornmeal (We use the same one would use for cornbread, best if stone-ground.)
- Two teaspoons of salt (Taste it throughout the cooking, use this amount for safety)
- Two tablespoons of cooking oil (Optional)


## Directions

1. Add the water to a pot and heat it to a rolling boil.
2. Add salt (and optional oil)
3. Slowly add the cornmeal, while mixing it with a wooden spoon or a big whisk.
4. Keep mixing. If it feels too thick or thin, add more water or cornmeal, respectively. Keep in mind it will thicken with time.
5. When it  has the consistency of a porridge and stops sticking to the pan (roughly 40min), remove it from heat and put it on a bowl or casserole.
6. A lot of it gets permanently stuck to the pan, just fill it with cold water, and in less than a day you can remove that skin.

## Extras

Polenta is pretty bland by itself, and eaten fresh, is delicious with elaborate meat sauces and stews, like these:
- [Traditional beef or lamb stew](https://based.cooking/beef-stew/), [Carbonade Flamande](https://based.cooking/carbonade/) or [Bolognese Sauce](https://based.cooking/bolognese-sauce/).

In my region, we also have it with a runny scrambled egg dish similar to a [frittata](https://based.cooking/frittata/), with pan-fried salami and semi-firm colonial cheese. Small kids have it with whole milk, i used to eat it with rice. Also, they used to make kids dance [a song about it](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=-nisfL47OCw).

Leftover polenta, refrigerated or not, will get firmer and have a "shell" to it. Cut it into thick strips, put it on a frying pan, brown both sides and eat it with salami or steak!
