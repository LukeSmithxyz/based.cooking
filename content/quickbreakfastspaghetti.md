A quick breakfast spaghetti recipe that covers a healthy amount of carbs, fat, and spices. Eggs
and/or bacon can be added to cover some protein, you should cook those while the boiler is cooking
the spaghetti for time efficiency.

## Ingredients

- Spaghetti (any kind you prefer)
- Ground spices (I like to use cumin, turmeric, paprika, and garlic)
- Tomato Paste/Sauce (preferably one with basil and without preservative)
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil

## Directions

1. Boil some water fully and prepare a pot.
2. While the water is boiling, add all your spices in the pot with the spaghetti on top.
3. Pour the boiled water on the spaghetti to make it soft so you can immerse it fully in the water.
4. Mix thoroughly the water with the spices and salt and pepper if needed.
5. Place the pot on the stove, keep it boiling, and stir every minute or two for 8 minutes.
6. It should take no more than 8 minutes, but you can check if it is fully cooked by tasting one piece at a time.
7. Once it is fully cooked, strain the water from the pot and keep the spaghetti in.
8. Before placing it back on the stove, add and mix a generous amount of olive oil. Now's the time to add bacon or turkey if you are also using that.
9. While stirring the spaghetti, add your tomato sauce or paste and keep mixing for a minute and avoid letting it stick to the boiler.
10. Pour the spaghetti out in your favorite bowl and enjoy!
