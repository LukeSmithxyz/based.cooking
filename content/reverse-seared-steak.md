Reverse searing a steak means cooking it to the desired doneness in the oven at a low temperature before searing it to get that nice crust over high heat. It keeps the internal moisture of the steak intact through the cook and leads to incredibly tender, perfectly done steaks.

- ⏲️ Prep time: 1-2 hours
- 🍳 Cook time: 20-40 min
- 🍽️ Servings: 1/per steak

## Ingredients

- A good steak (I've had great results with ribeyes and tri tip, anything with good marbling should work well)
- Cooking oil or butter


## Directions

1. Leave your steak(s) out at room temperature for 1-2 hours prior to cooking. This step is very important to getting a consistant cook throughout, so don't skip it.
2. Preheat your oven to 250 degrees, then cook your steak(s) for 20 minutes on a rack over a baking sheet.
3. At 20 minutes, use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the thickest part of the steak. You're looking for about 15 degrees below your intended finished temperature. If the temperature is too low, return the steak(s) to the oven for 5-10 more minutes and check again. I've had thicker steaks take 35-40 minutes on occasion, it'll definitely take longer if you skip the first step. I shoot for between 105 and 115 degrees.
4. Add high smoke point oil or butter to a heavy, preferably cast-iron skillet, and heat it over high heat. Sear your steak(s) for 30 seconds to one minute per side. I like to use a lot of butter and continuously baste the steak with it while it's searing.
5. Let the steak(s) rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.
