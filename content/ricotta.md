The ricotta is an Italian cheese made by cooking the whey (liquid byproduct of the cheese production), by cooking it at an high temperature (80-90°C), hence the name "ricotta", which means "cooked again". Even though it's typically made from the whey, you can make it directly from the milk as well.

## Ingredients

- thermometer
- 1 cheesecloth
- 1 cheese recipient
- 2l of whey
- 500ml of milk (or if not using whey, 2l of milk)
- 10g of table salt
- 6g of citric acid (contained in 130ml of lemon juice)

## Directions

### Preparation

Pour the milk (and/or whey) and the salt into a pot, stir it well, and heat it up to 80°C.
Once the temperature has been reached, add the citric acid (or lemon juice) and stir well. You should already see the citric acid react with the milk/whey.
Heat it up to 90°C
Pour the ricotta in the cheesecloth and let the whey drip.
Move the ricotta into the cheese recipient.
Store in the fridge.
