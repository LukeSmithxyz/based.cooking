This is a meatloaf recipe that I synthesized from a couple of different recipes that use ground beef. It is unique among other meatloaf recipes in that it includes Italian sausage and is cooked in a slow cooker (otherwise known as a crockpot).
This method of using a slow cooker renders the meatloaf into a tender and juicy dish (i.e. it doesn't dry out the way oven-cooked meatloaf can be prone to do). I've found that this dish is filling enough to eat without needing to prepare a side dish.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 30 min (includes overnight marination)
- üç≥ Cook time: 6-8 hours
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 6-8

## Ingredients

- 1 1b. 85% lean ground beef
- 1 package of mild Italian sausage links
- Package of gourmet crackers (any kind works, though rosemary crackers are recommended)
- 2-3 large eggs
- 3/4 bottle of Zesty Italian dressing
- 3 Tbsp Worcester sauce
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce (optional, but recommended)
- Can of premade breadcrumbs
- Cavender's Greek Seasoning (or similar meat seasoning)
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1 small purple onion
- Ketchup (optional)

## Directions

1. Uncase your sausage links and combine with ground beef in a large mixing bowl.
2. Chop your purple onion to desired consistency and add to bowl (I find that coarsely chopped onions work well).
3. Combine rest of ingredients and, using your hands (or mixer), thoroughly mix the ingredients together into a homogenous paste. 
4. Line your slow-cooker with aluminum foil.
5. Dump the meatloaf mixture into your slow cooker and form it into a loaf.
6. Place the crock from your slow cooker in your refrigerator to marinate overnight.
7. Remove crock from refrigerator approximately 20-30 minutes before cooking (this allows the crock to come to room temperature to avoid cracking when the slow cooker turns on)
8. Cook on low for 6-8 hours. Check the meatloaf's internal temperature to make sure that it is cooked all the way through before serving.
9. At this point, you may remove and broil if you wish. I recommend stopping here and eating the meatloaf as it came out of the slow cooker.
