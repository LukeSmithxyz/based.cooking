## Ingredients

- 2 large potatoes
- 1/2 medium onion
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1. Grate the potatoes and onion using a cheese grater or food processor.
2. In a large bowl, combine the grated potatoes, onion, egg, flour, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.
3. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the butter or oil to the skillet and let it melt.

5. Cook the pancakes for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and crispy.
6. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture, adding more butter or oil to the skillet as needed.
7. Serve the pancakes hot, with sour cream and lingonberry jam, if desired. Enjoy!
