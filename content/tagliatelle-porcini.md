## Ingredients

- 400g fresh tagliatelle
- 500g fresh Porcini mushroom
- Fresh "nepetella" mint
- 1 garlic glove
- EVOO q.s.
- Mixwell salt, pepper and chopped chilli all together in a bowl

## Directions

1. Clean your Porcini (do not use water to wash them, mushrooms are porous)
2. Pour oil and garlic into a large pan. Brown over medium.
3. Remove the garlic. Add chopped Porcini.
4. Brown over medium for 15 minutes.
5. Add salt, pepper and chopped chilli.
6. Cook Tagliatelle in salty water. Drain pasta and saut√© them in the previous pan.
7. This type of pasta absorbs a lot of liquid and your tagliatelle would risk becoming too dry. To avoid this, while mixing them with the mushrooms in the pan, add the water a little at a time until you get the right creaminess.
8. Add "nepetella" mint
9. Ready to be served
