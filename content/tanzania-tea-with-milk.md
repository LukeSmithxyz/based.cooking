This is a very traditional simple beverage from Tanzania, a country in East Africa. While I stayed there in Mwanza and Dar es Salaam, they
would always have this option for breakfast (or in general).

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 5-10 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 3-8 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 1

## Ingredients

- Black Ceylon Tea (Preferably, you want a dark, herbal flavor from your tea. I have some from Dar es Salaam,
but when I tried researching, I couldn't find out what kind of tea it is. No, they didn't list the ingredients on
the box lol)
- Milk/Sweet Cream
- Sweetener (Sugar, Syrup, Monk Fruit extract, etc.) (optional, but recommended)

## Directions

1. Bring some hot water to boil and seep the tea. Depending on how strong you like it, you can do this for up to 10 min at most.
Be warned; typically black teas are very strong.
2. When done seeping, add in the milk (or cream).
3. Sweeten to taste. Remember you can always add more if there isn't enough.
