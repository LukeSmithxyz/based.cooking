## Ingredients

- 2 Chicken Breasts
- 1 Tbsp Turkish Spice Blend
- 1 oz Almonds, sliced
- 3/4 cup Basmati Rice
- 12 oz Sweet Potato
- 2 oz Onion, chopped
- 100 mL Greek Yogurt
- 2 Tbsp Parsley
- 1 Lemon
- 1/2 tsp Garlic Salt
- 1 1/2 cup Chicken Broth
- 1 tsp Sugar

## Directions

1. Cut sweet potatoes into 1/2 inch pieces. Combine and toss sweet potatoes, half the onions, half the garlic salt, and a tablespoon of oil. Lay to a baking sheet and roast on the middle rack of the oven, stirring halfway through until golden brown (12-22 mins).
2. While sweet potatoes roast, heat a medium pot over medium-high heat. When hot, add a tablespoon of oil and remaining onions. Cook, stirring often until fragrant (1 min). Add chicken broth and rice, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and leave covered until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed (12-14 mins). Remove pot from heat, still covered.
3. While rice cooks, heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add almonds to the dry pan. Toast, stirring occasionally until golden brown (2-3 mins). When almonds are done, transfer to a plate and set aside.
4. While almonds toast, pat chicken dry with paper towel. Sprinkle with Turkish Spice blend and the remaining garlic salt. Season with pepper. With the pan used in the last step, increase heat to medium-high. Add a tablespoon of oil and the chicken. Pan-fry until golden brown (1-2 min per side). Transfer chicken to another baking sheet. Roast on the top rack of the oven until chicken is cooked through (10-12 mins).
5. While chicken roasts, zest and juice half the lemon. Cut remaining lemon into wedges. Roughly chop parsley. Add yogurt, half the parsley, sugar, lemon zest and juice to a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, and whisk to combine.
6. Fluff rice with a fork, then stir in almonds and remaining parsley. Slice chicken. Divide rice between plates, then top with sweet potatoes and chicken. Spoon yogurt sauce over top. Squeeze over a lemon wedge, as desired.
