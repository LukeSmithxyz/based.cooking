The ricotta is an italian cheese made by cooking the whey (liquid byproduct of the cheese production), by cooking it at an high temperature (80-90°C), hence the name "ricotta", which means "cooked again".

## Ingredients

- thermometer
- 1 cheesecloth 
- 1 cheese recipient
- 2l of whey
- 500ml of milk
- 10g of table salt
- 6g of citric acid (contained in 130ml of lemon juice) 

## Directions

### Preparation

Pour the milk, the whey and the salt into a pot, stir it well, and heat it up to 80°C.
Once the temperature has been reached, add the citric acid (or lemon juice) and stir well. You should already see the citric acid react with the whey and milk.
Heat it up to 90°C
Pour the ricotta in the cheesecloth and let the whey drip.
Move the ricotta into the cheese recipient.
Store in the fridge.
