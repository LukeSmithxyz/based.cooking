## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup Arborio Rice
- 1 cup Baby Spinach
- 2 Garlic Cloves
- 4 1/2 cup Vegetable Broth
- 1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese, shredded
- 1/2 lb Baby Tomatoes
- 1 Tbsp White Wine Vinegar
- 1/4 cup Walnuts, chopped
- 1/2 cup Leek, sliced
- 1 cup Mushrooms
- 3 Tbsp Unsalted Butter


## Directions

1. Combine vegetable broth in a medium pot. Cover and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. While broth comes to a boil, peel and mince/grate the garlic. Roughly chop the spinach. Thinly slice mushrooms.
2. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add the butter, onions, leeks, and mushrooms. Season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened (2-3 mins). Add rice, garlic, and vinegar. Cook, stirring constantly until fragrant (1-2 min).
3. Add 1 cup broth from the medium pot to the pan with rice. Stir until broth has been absorbed by rice. Continue adding broth 1 cup at a time, stirring regularly, until liquid is absorbed, the texture is creamy and the rice is tender (28-30 mins).
4. While risotto cooks, add tomatoes and a tablespoon of oil to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper, then toss to coat. Roast on the middle rack of the oven until tomatoes start to burst (10-11 mins).
5. When the last cup of broth has been absorbed and rice is tender and creamy, add Parmesan and spinach to risotto. Stir until spinach wilts (3-4 mins). Stir in roasted tomatoes. Divide risotto between bowls. Sprinkle walnuts over top.
