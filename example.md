# This is the dish title

If necessary, provide a very brief description of the dish in one or two sentences.
For most dishes, this will be unnecessary.
If there is a title image of this dish, it should be above this paragraph.
You may also include prep/cook time and the number of servings as below:

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 10 min
- üç≥Cook time: 30 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4

## Ingredients

- List the ingredients
- in an unordered list
- similar to this.
- List amounts if necessary.
- Put (optional) at the end of optional ingredients

## Directions

1. Now using an ordered list,
2. give the directions to prepare the dish.
3. Do **not** add unnecessary blank lines between items.
4. If necessary,
5. an image can be included between some directions if needed to explain something particular.
6. But that should be kept to a minimum to reduce bandwidth and aid in simplicity.
