If necessary, provide a very brief description of the dish in one or two sentences.
For most dishes, this will be unnecessary.
If there is a title image of this dish, it should be above this paragraph.
You may also include prep/cook time and the number of servings as below:

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 10 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 30 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4

## Ingredients

- There must be a blank line above all lists.
- List the ingredients
- in an unordered list
- similar to this.
- List amounts if necessary.
- Put (optional) at the end of optional ingredients

## Directions

1. Now using an ordered list,
2. give the directions to prepare the dish.
3. Do **not** add unnecessary blank lines between items.
4. If necessary,
5. an image can be included between some directions if needed to explain something particular.
6. But that should be kept to a minimum to reduce bandwidth and aid in simplicity.

Note that you can create a `your-name.json` file in `data/authors` to add
personal links and donation addresses if you want more specific credit. If you
do this, for the `author:` line the in the metadata, include the bare file name
of the json file. For example, my file is `data/authors/luke-smith.json`, so I
would put `author: luke-smith`.
