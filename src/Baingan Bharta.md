## Ingredients
- Aubergine
- Onion
- Tomatoes
- Garlic
- Green Chili
- Red Chili Powder
- Oil
- Coriander Leaves
- salt

## Directions
- Rinse the baingan (eggplant or aubergine) in water. Pat dry with a kitchen napkin. Apply some oil all over and
- keep it for roasting on an open flame. You can also grill the baingan or roast in the oven. But then you won't get
- the smoky flavor of the baingan. Keep the eggplant turning after a 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that its evenly
- cooked. You could also embed some garlic cloves in the baingan and then roast it
- 2. Roast the aubergine till its completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should slid
- easily in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools
- down
- 3. You can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the baingan. This is an optional step
- Use natural charcoal for this method. Heat a small piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes smoking hot and red
- 4. Make small cuts on the baingan with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted
- aubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The charcoal would begin to smoke
- 5. As soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the
- charcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 2 minutes. The more you do, the more smoky the baingan bharta will
- become. I just keep for a minute. Alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is
- cooked, just like the way we do for Dal Tadka
- 6. Peel the skin from the roasted and smoked eggplant
- 7. Chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it
- 8. In a kadai or pan, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic
- 9. Saute the onions till translucent. Don't brown them
- 10. Add chopped green chilies and saute for a minute
- 11. Add the chopped tomatoes and mix it well
- 12. Bhuno (saute) the tomatoes till the oil starts separating from the mixture
- 13. Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix well
- 14. Add the chopped cooked baingan
- 15. Stir and mix the chopped baingan very well with the onionÂ­tomato masala mixture
- 16. Season with salt. Stir and saute for some more 4 to 5 minutes more
- 17. Finally stir in the coriander leaves with the baingan bharta or garnish it with them. Serve Baingan Bharta with
- phulkas, rotis or chapatis. It goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera rice.
