## Ingredients
- plain flour
- chilled butter
- cold water
- raspberry jam
- butter
- caster sugar
- ground almonds
- free-range egg, beaten
- almond extract
- flaked almonds

## Directions
- To make the pastry, measure the flour into a bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the water, mixing to form a soft dough
- Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface and use to line a 20cm/8in flan tin. Leave in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes
- Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 (180C fan)
- Line the pastry case with foil and fill with baking beans. Bake blind for about 15 minutes, then remove the beans and foil and cook for a further five minutes to dry out the base
- For the filing, spread the base of the flan generously with raspberry jam
- Melt the butter in a pan, take off the heat and then stir in the sugar. Add ground almonds, egg and almond extract. Pour into the flan tin and sprinkle over the flaked almonds
- Bake for about 35 minutes. If the almonds seem to be browning too quickly, cover the tart loosely with foil to prevent them burning.
