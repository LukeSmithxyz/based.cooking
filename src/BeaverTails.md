## Directions
- In the bowl of a stand mixer, add warm water, a big pinch of sugar and yeast. Allow to sit until frothy
- Into the same bowl, add 1/2 cup sugar, warm milk, melted butter, eggs and salt, and whisk until combined
- Place a dough hook on the mixer, add the flour with the machine on, until a smooth but slightly sticky dough forms
- Place dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to proof for 1 1/2 hours
- Cut dough into 12 pieces, and roll out into long oval-like shapes about 1/4 inch thick that resemble a beaverâ€™s tail
- In a large, deep pot, heat oil to 350 degrees. Gently place beavertail dough into hot oil and cook for 30 to 45 seconds on each side until golden brown
- Drain on paper towels, and garnish as desired. Toss in cinnamon sugar, in white sugar with a squeeze of lemon, or with a generous slathering of Nutella and a handful of toasted almonds. Enjoy!
