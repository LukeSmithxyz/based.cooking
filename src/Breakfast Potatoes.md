## Ingredients
- Potatoes
- Olive Oil
- Bacon
- Garlic Clove
- Maple Syrup
- Parsley
- Salt
- Pepper
- Allspice

## Directions
- Before you do anything, freeze your bacon slices that way when you're ready to prep, it'll be so much easier to chop!
- Wash the potatoes and cut medium dice into square pieces. To prevent any browning, place the already cut potatoes in a bowl filled with water
- In the meantime, heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Tilt the skillet so the oil spreads evenly
- Once the oil is hot, drain the potatoes and add to the skillet. Season with salt, pepper, and Old Bay as needed
- Cook for 10 minutes, stirring the potatoes often, until brown. If needed, add a tablespoon more of oil
- Chop up the bacon and add to the potatoes. The bacon will start to render and the fat will begin to further cook the potatoes. Toss it up a bit! The bacon will take 5-6 minutes to crisp
- Once the bacon is cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low, add the minced garlic and toss. Season once more. Add dried or fresh parsley. Control heat as needed
- Let the garlic cook until fragrant, about one minute
- Just before serving, drizzle over the maple syrup and toss. Let that cook another minute, giving the potatoes a caramelized effect
- Serve in a warm bowl with a sunny side up egg!
