## Ingredients
- Kale
- Bacon
- Garlic
- Onion
- Paprika
- Thyme

- Banana
- Vegetable Oil

## Directions
- Cut leaves and soft stems from the kale branches, them soak in a bowl of cold water for about 5-10 minutes or until finish with prep
- Proceed to slicing the onions, mincing the garlic and dicing the tomatoes. Set aside
- Remove kale from water cut in chunks
- Place bacon on saucepan and cook until crispy. Then add onions, garlic, thyme, stir for about a minute or more
- Add tomatoes; scotch bonnet pepper, smoked paprika. Saut√© for about 2-3 more minutes
- Finally add vegetable, salt, mix well, and steamed for about 6-8 minutes or until leaves are tender. Add a tiny bit of water as needed. Adjust seasonings and turn off the heat
- Using a sharp knife cut both ends off the plantain. This will make it easy to grab the skin of the plantains. Slit a shallow line down the long seam of the plantain; peel only as deep as the peel. Remove plantain peel by pulling it back
- Slice the plantain into medium size lengthwise slices and set aside
- Coat a large frying pan with cooking oil spray. Spray the tops of the plantains with a generous layer of oil spray and sprinkle with salt, freshly ground pepper
- Let the plantains "fry" on medium heat, shaking the frying pan to redistribute them every few minutes
- As the plantains brown, continue to add more cooking oil spray, salt and pepper (if needed) until they have reached the desired color and texture
- Remove and serve with kale
