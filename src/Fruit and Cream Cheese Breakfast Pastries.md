## Ingredients
- Cream Cheese
- Sugar
- Vanilla Extract
- Flour
- Puff Pastry
- Strawberries
- Raspberries
- Blackberries

## Directions
- Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC), and prepare two cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a bowl, mix cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until fully combined. Lightly flour the surface and roll out puff pastry on top to flatten. Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 equal squares. On the top right and bottom left of the pastry, cut an L shape approximately ½ inch (1 cm) from the edge
- NOTE: This L shape should reach all the way down and across the square, however both L shapes should not meet at the ends. Your pastry should look like a picture frame with two corners still intact
- Take the upper right corner and fold down towards the inner bottom corner. You will now have a diamond shape
- Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of the cream cheese filling in the middle, then place berries on top
- Repeat with the remaining pastry squares and place them onto the parchment covered baking sheet
- Bake for 15-20 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and puffed
- Enjoy!
