## Directions
- Make the Pastry Dough
- To a large bowl, add flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and turmeric and mix thoroughly
- Rub shortening into flour until there are small pieces of shortening completely covered with flour
- Pour in 1/2 cup of the ice water and mix with your hands to bring the dough together. Keep adding ice water 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time until the mixture forms a dough
- At this stage, you can cut the dough into 2 large pieces, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before using it
- Alternatively, cut the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces, place on a platter or baking sheet, cover securely with plastic wrap and let chill for 30 minutes while you make the filling
- Make the Filling
- Add ground beef to a large bowl. Sprinkle in allspice and black pepper. Mix together and set aside
- Heat oil in a skillet until hot
- Add onions and sauté until translucent. Add hot pepper, garlic and thyme and continue to sauté for another minute. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Add seasoned ground beef and toss to mix, breaking up any clumps, and let cook until the meat is no longer pink
- Add ketchup and more salt to taste
- Pour in 2 cups of water and stir. Bring the mixture to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated and whatever is remaining has reduced to a thick sauce
- Fold in green onions. Remove from heat and let cool completely
- Assemble the Patties
- Beat the egg and water together to make an egg wash. Set aside
- Now you can prepare the dough in two ways
- First Method: Flour the work surface and rolling pin. If you had cut it into 2 large pieces, then take one of the large pieces and roll it out into a very large circle. Take a bowl with a wide rim (about 5 inches) and cut out three circles
- Place about 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling onto 1/2 of each circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal. 
- Take a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue to work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties
- Second Method: If you had pre-cut the dough into individual pieces, work with one piece of dough at a time. Roll it out on a floured surface into a 5-inch circle or a little larger. Don’t worry if the edges are not perfect
- Place 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling on one side of the circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal
- Take a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties
- Frying and Serving the Patties
- After forming the patties, place the pans in the refrigerator while you heat the oven to 350 F
- Just before adding the pans with the patties to the oven, brush the patties with egg wash
- Bake patties for 30 minutes or until golden brown
- Cool on wire racks
- Serve warm.
