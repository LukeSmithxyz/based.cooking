## Ingredients
- Chicken
- Oil
- Egg White
- Flour
- Brown Sugar
- Salt
- paprika
- onion salt
- chili powder
- black pepper
- celery salt
- sage
- garlic powder
- allspice
- oregano
- basil
- marjoram

## Directions
- Preheat fryer to 350°F. Thoroughly mix together all the spice mix ingredients
- Combine spice mix with flour, brown sugar and salt
- Dip chicken pieces in egg white to lightly coat them, then transfer to flour mixture. Turn a few times and make sure the flour mix is really stuck to the chicken. Repeat with all the chicken pieces
- Let chicken pieces rest for 5 minutes so crust has a chance to dry a bit
- Fry chicken in batches. Breasts and wings should take 12-14 minutes, and legs and thighs will need a few more minutes. Chicken pieces are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165°F
- Let chicken drain on a few paper towels when it comes out of the fryer. Serve hot.
