# It is Chicken it isn't rocket science.
Kurczak z napierdolonym od chuja majonezem is a very tasty chicken. In general you pick how much of a chicken you want to put in and show many potatoes you need, what spices to use, I just tell you to do the usual but puts mayo on it. Straight to the point. Do as you do, add mayo put in oven bahm. Your chicken dinner is now ten times better. 

## Ingredients
- Chicken meat you know
- Mayonaise
- Potato
- Your favourite spices you usually smear your chicken/meat with!
- Idfk any kind of salad you want to eat with it
- Oven
- A thing you would put cut potatoes and chicken on and then put it into oven

## Directions
1. Clean your chicken, cut it at the chest in between the two breasts, we want the chicken to more easily spread.
2. Put spices on your chicken(a bit less than usually).
3. Smear your chicken in mayo.
4. Now add spices to it.
5. Put it into thingy.
6. Get the potatoes cut down into somewhat equal pieces, smear them with mayo, add spices to them after smearing.
7. Put potatoes around the chicken.
8. Now you just put it into oven, and make sure you don't eat your chicken raw, the potato will get nice crispy and it is also not dry inside. :o oh wow amazing.
