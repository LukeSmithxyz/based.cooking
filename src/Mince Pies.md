## Ingredients
- Butter
- Plain Flour
- Caster Sugar
- Mincemeat
- Egg
- Icing Sugar

## Directions
- To make the pastry, rub 225g cold, diced butter into 350g plain flour, then mix in 100g golden caster sugar and a pinch of salt
- Combine the pastry into a ball – don’t add liquid – and knead it briefly. The dough will be fairly firm, like shortbread dough. You can use the dough immediately, or chill for later
- Preheat the oven to 200C/gas 6/fan 180C. Line 18 holes of two 12-hole patty tins, by pressing small walnut-sized balls of pastry into each hole
- Spoon 280g mincemeat into the pies
- Take slightly smaller balls of pastry than before and pat them out between your hands to make round lids, big enough to cover the pies. 
- Top the pies with their lids, pressing the edges gently together to seal – you don’t need to seal them with milk or egg as they will stick on their own. (The pies may now be frozen for up to 1 month)
- Beat 1 small egg and brush the tops of the pies. Bake for 20 mins until golden. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 mins, then remove to a wire rack
- To serve, lightly dust with icing sugar.
