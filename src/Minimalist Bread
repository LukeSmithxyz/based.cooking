# Minimalist Bread Recipe

Bloat is everywhere, even in simple things such as bread.
Lots of additives, sugars and various poisons.
This is the recipe for simple, quick and healthy bread.

## Ingredients

* Flour of your choice
* Water
* Pinch of salt ( optional )

## Instructions

1. Put some flour in a bowl
2. Add water and little salt
3. Mix with either a large wooden spoon or hands, adding water to make it more sticky, or adding flour to make it less sticky
4. Put some vegetable oil in pan, place loaf inside and turn the oven to around 250 C (482 F)
5. Bake it for 30 minutes ( Create timer as a reminder )
6. Enojy your warm bread, best served immediately

## Notes

* It would be best if you could grind the flour yourself 
* If mixing with hands, make sure they are clean
* You can use all sorts of flours, wheat flours work great but feel free to experiment
* Clean the mixing bowl immediately with water, as it is easier to wash it before flour hardens
* Eat it within few days or it will go bad, as there are no chemicals to prolong its shelf life
* If it is too hard to eat after a few days, use it with soups and similar liquids
