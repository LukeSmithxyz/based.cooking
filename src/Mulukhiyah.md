## Ingredients
- Mulukhiyah
- Onion
- Beef
- Salt
- Water
- Garlic Clove
- Olive Oil

## Directions
- Saute the onions in the 3-4 tablespoons olive oil
- Add the beef cubes or the chicken cutlets, sear for 3-4 min on each side
- Add 1 liter of water or just enough to cover the meat
- Cook over medium heat until the meat is done (I usually do this in the pressure cooker and press them for 5 min)
- Add the frozen mulukhyia and stir until it thaws completely and then comes to a boil
- In another pan add the 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil and the cloves of garlic and cook over medium low heat until you can smell the garlic (donâ€™t brown it, it will become bitter)
- Add the oil and garlic to the mulukhyia and lower the heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes
- Add salt to taste
- Serve with a generous amount of lemon juice
- You can serve it with some short grain rice or some pita bread
