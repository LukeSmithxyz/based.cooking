## Directions
- Sift flour and salt into a large mixing bowl
- Use a spoon to push the egg yolk through a fine sieve into the flour
- Add the raw egg and mix well
- Beat in butter 1 tablespoon at a time
- Place dough on a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, then wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate until firm (at least 30 minutes)
- In a heavy skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat; saute the onion and rutabaga until the onion is soft and transparent (5 minutes)
- Put the onions, rutabaga, and beef through a meat grinder twice if you have one, if not just chop them up as fine as possible
- Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat, and add the meat mixture
- Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until all of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape
- Remove from heat and let cool, then stir in 1 egg, and season with salt and pepper
- Preheat oven to 350Â°F
- On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 13x8" rectangle (1/8" thick)
- Spoon the filling down the center of the rectangle lengthwise, leaving about an inch of space on each end
- Lightly brush the long sides with cold water, then fold one of the long sides over the filling and the other side over the top of that
- Brush the short ends with cold water and fold them over the top, enclosing the filling
- Place pastry seam side down on a baking sheet and brush the top evenly with the remaining scrambled egg
- Bake in preheated oven until rich golden brown (30 minutes)
- Slice pastry diagonally into 1.5" long pieces and serve as an appetizer or with soup.
