## Ingredients
- Water
- Sugar
- Yeast
- Plain Flour
- Salt
- Olive Oil
- Passata
- Mozzarella
- Oregano
- Basil
- Black Pepper

## Directions
- 1 Preheat the oven to 230°C
- 2 Add the sugar and crumble the fresh yeast into warm water
- 3 Allow the mixture to stand for 10 – 15 minutes in a warm place (we find a windowsill on a sunny day works best) until froth develops on the surface
- 4 Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil
- 5 Lightly flour your hands, and slowly mix the ingredients together until they bind
- 6 Generously dust your surface with flour
- 7 Throw down the dough and begin kneading for 10 minutes until smooth, silky and soft
- 8 Place in a lightly oiled, non-stick baking tray (we use a round one, but any shape will do!)
- 9 Spread the passata on top making sure you go to the edge
- 10 Evenly place the mozzarella (or other cheese) on top, season with the oregano and black pepper, then drizzle with a little olive oil
- 11 Cook in the oven for 10 – 12 minutes until the cheese slightly colours
- 12 When ready, place the basil leaf on top and tuck in!
