## Ingredients
- Chicken Legs
- Onions
- Carrots
- Leek
- Celery
- Cabbage
- Cloves
- Allspice
- Bay Leaf
- Parsley
- Dill
- Pepper
- Salt

## Directions
- Add chicken to a large Dutch oven or stock pot 
- Cover with water
- Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, skimming any impurities off the top to insure a clear broth
- If your pot is big enough, add the vegetables and spices for the last hour of the cooking time
- My Dutch oven wasn’t big enough to hold everything, just the chicken and other bones filled the pot, so I cooked the meat/bones for the full cooking time, then removed them, and cooked the vegetables and spices separately
- Strain everything out of the broth
- Bone the chicken, pulling the meat into large chunks
- Slice the carrots
- Return the chicken and carrots to the broth
- Cook noodles according to package instructions if you’re using them
- Add noodles to bowl and then top with hot soup
