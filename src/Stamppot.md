## Ingredients
- Potatoes
- Bay Leaf
- Shallots
- Butter
- Kale
- Sausages
- Milk
- Nutmeg
- Salt
- Pepper

## Directions
- 
- Wash and peel the potatoes and cut into similarly sized pieces for even cooking
- In a large soup pot, boil the potatoes and the bay leaves in salted water for 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaves
- If you're not using a bag of ready-cut curly kale, wash the bunches thoroughly under cool running water to get rid of all soilâ€”you wouldn't want that gritty texture in your finished dish. Trim any coarse stems and discard any brown leaves. With a sharp knife, cut the curly kale into thin strips
- Peel and chop the shallots
- In a frying pan or skillet, melt 1 tbsp. of butter and saute the shallots for a few minutes before adding the curly kale and 2 tbsp. of water. Season and cook for about 10 minutes, or until tender
- Warm the milk on the stove or in the microwave
- Drain, shake and dry the potatoes with kitchen towels before mashing with a potato masher or ricer. Working quickly, add the warm milk and the remaining butter. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. 
- Mix the cooked curly kale through the cooked mashed potato mixture
- Top with slices of the smoked sausage and serve hot with your favorite mustard or gravy
- Serve and enjoy!
