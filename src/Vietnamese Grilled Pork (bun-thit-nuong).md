## Ingredients
- Pork
- Rice Vermicelli
- Egg Rolls
- Challots
- Garlic
- Sugar
- Fish Sauce
- Soy sauce
- Pepper
- Olive Oil
- Cucumber
- Mint
- Peanuts

## Directions
- Slice the uncooked pork thinly, about â…›". It helps to slightly freeze it (optional)
- Mince garlic and shallots. Mix in a bowl with sugar, fish sauce, thick soy sauce, pepper, and oil until sugar dissolves
- Marinate the meat for 1 hour, or overnight for better results
- Bake the pork at 375F for 10-15 minutes or until about 80% cooked. Finish cooking by broiling in the oven until a nice golden brown color develops, flipping the pieces midway
- Assemble your bowl with veggies, noodles, and garnish. Many like to mix the whole bowl up and pour the fish sauce on top, but I like to make individual bites and sauce it slowly.
