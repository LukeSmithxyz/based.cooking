# Alfredo Chicken Toast

Garlic Bread + Alfredo + Chicken. Yum.

- Prep time: 10 min
- Cook time: 10 min
- Servings: 8 pieces

## Ingredients

#### Chicken
- 4 chicken tenders
- any other spices (optional, but recommended)
- butter (if cooking in a pan)

#### Alfredo
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup shredded/grated parmesan cheese (or 1/2 cup parmesan, 1/2 cup romano)
- 1 tbsp butter
- onion powder
- garlic powder

#### Toast
- 8 slices of toast (for simplicity, I use the prepackaged garlic bread)
- 8 slices of mozarella

## Directions

1. Prepare the toast. If using premade garlic bread, separate out 8 slices and bake them according to
directions.
2. Cut each chicken tender in half, width-wise, to fit the toast better, and then add spices.
3. Add just enough butter to coat the pan, and then grill the chicken.
4. For alfredo, add butter and cream to a pot and heat up, do not let boil.
5. When hot, add in the cheese and mix until it fully combines, and then keep the heat on for a couple more minutes (the sauce will still be a little watery, it will thicken as it cools).
6. Mix in garlic and onion powder.
7. When everything is finished, move the toast to a tray, and add one mozerella slice per toast.
8. Add chicken tenders next, one piece per toast.
9. Cover in alfredo sauce.
