- üç≥ Cook time: 35 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 12 slices

## Ingredients

- 500g white wheat flour
- 1 packet (7g) dry yeast
- 50g sugar
- 1 packet (8g) vanilla sugar
- 1 tsp. salt
- 2-3 (275g) bananas (preferably very ripe)
- 75g + 50g butter
- 100ml milk (plus some to coat bread)
- 75g milk chocolate
- 25g powdered sugar
- 2 tbsp. cocoa powder
- baking paper


## Directions

1. Mix flour, dry yeast, sugar, vanilla sugar and salt in a large bowl. Mash bananas and add to the bowl.
2. Melt 75g of butter at low heat, then add milk and wait until it is lukewarm. Add warm fluid to dry ingredients and knead into smooth dough.
3. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let dough rise in warm place for 60 minutes.
4. For the filling break chocolate into small pieces and melt together with 50g of butter at low heat. Let it cool down a little, then mix with powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Keep warm for easy coating of dough.
5. Line loaf pan with baking paper. Knead dough again shortly, then roll out to a rectangle (40x50cm) on floured surface. Spread filling evenly, but leave edge of 1-2cm blank.
6. Cut dough in half on larger side, then roll up both halves tightly from the cutting edge. Braid strands together, then place bread in loaf pan. Cut strands on top with a sharp knife so that filling becomes visible. Cover loaf pan with a cloth and let dough rise for another 15 minutes.
7. Preheat oven to 175¬∞C / 350¬∞F. Brush down bread with some milk. Cover bread with edge of the baking paper in oven (clamp under loaf pan). Bake for 35-40 minutes. Check with a wooden chopstick, it's done when it comes out clean.
8. Wait for the bread to cool down before cutting.
