# Banana Bread

## Description
Especially good for bananas you'd otherwise throw away.

## Ingredients
- 3 mashed bananas
- 2 eggs
- 2.5 dessert spoon of olive oil (or butter, or combo)
- Cinnamon
- 1 Tsp baking soda
- Bit over half cup oats, blended (add extra at end if recipe is too runny)
- Bit over half cup dessicated coconut, blended
- Dash maple syrup
- Half cup frozen blueberries (optional)

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 180 celsius.
2. Mash the banana, then add eggs, butter/oil, maple syrup & mix.
3. Once mixed, add dry ingredients and add the blueberries at the end.
4. Pour batter into a lined bread tin. If you want to be fancy, you can slice a banana length wise and place each half on top of the batter in the bread tin (spread a little butter and sugar on top of the banana slices if you want them to caramelize).
5. Bake for around 35/40 minutes, until it looks golden and yummy.
