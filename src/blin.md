# Blin

Zdravstvuyte tovarischi. A popular delicacy in Russia due to its ease of cooking and excellent taste. The blin takes the form of a thin pancake, similar to a [crepe](https://based.cooking/french-crepes).

## Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 200 g (7 oz) of flour
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
- 50 g (2 oz) of butter

## Directions

1. Mix and stir water (5 oz/150 ml), milk (400 ml/14 oz), salt (0.25 teaspoon), and sugar (2-3 tablespoons) together.
2. Add in eggs, then thoroughly whip the mix with a whisk.
3. While whipping the mix, gradually pour in flour through a sieve. Make certain that there are no lumps, and that the flour mixes completely.
4. Pour in vegetable oil and mix together.
5. Heat up the frying pan.
6. Pour some of the mix onto the pan, then rotate the pan side-to-side in order to spread the mix in an even circle.
7. Leave the result to fry for about 20 seconds.
8. Use a tool (knife, turner, spatula, hand, etc.) to flip over the blin onto the other side. Wait for another 20 seconds.
9. Take the blin off the frying pan and place onto a plate.
10. Repeat steps 6-9 until you run out of mix.
11. (Optional) Fill blin with miscellaneous ingredients and wrap it around like a tortilla. Anything from condensed milk, to jams, to chicken works fine.
