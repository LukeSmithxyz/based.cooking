# Very Simple Breakfast Hash

It doesn't take that much time to prep and is a good hearty meal to start
your day with.

## Ingredients

Portions are to a general taste, I just eyeball how much I want and it usually
works out. Some of it also depends on the sizes before hand processing.

* Butter
* Hashbrowns or Diced Potatoes
* Bacon (cut into smaller bits, if preferred)
* Eggs (normally 2-3 and preferably homegrown)
* (Optional) Milk (Raw works pretty well)
* Cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat up your pan and add the butter to grease it up.
2. Add your hashbrowns or potatoes and brown them up a bit. (This is where I
normally cut the bacon strips into pieces, allowing some time for the
potatoes to cook.)
3. Add your bacon and cook it up with the hashbrowns or potatoes.
4. Scramble up your eggs in a bowl and mix with a little milk, if desired.
5. Once, the bacon is cooked to your liking, slowly add in the egg mixture.
Mixing up the hash as you add it allows for you to get a more even distribution
of the egg.
6. Once the egg is sufficiently cooked, spread out the hash in the pan and top
with cheese. You can then remove from the pan and grab your eating implements.

You can add salsa on top for a change in taste, or any other sauce. The hash is
usually warm enough to melt most of the cheese.

Cast-iron has been the only thing I have cooked this in, so results may vary in
other pans.
