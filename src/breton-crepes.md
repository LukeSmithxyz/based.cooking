# Breton Crêpes (Breton Galettes)
Buckwheat crêpes eaten as dishes, traditionally garnished with ham, eggs and cheese (galette complète).

~15/20 galettes.

## Ingredients

- 500g buckwheat flour
- 1 egg
- 70cl water

## Directions

1. Mix flour, salt, egg and water. (In this order to avoid dry flour)
2. Let it rest one hour at room temperature.
3. Cook the galette on a crepe-maker or a big flat pan.
4. When garnishing, heat the galette again with a bit of salted butter.

Always keep the crepe-maker's T stick in water while cooking so the dough doesn't dry on it.
It will then be easier to spread the dough.
