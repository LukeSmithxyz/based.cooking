# Brigadeiro

![Brigadeiro](pix/brigadeiro.webp)

A very traditional Brazilian dessert that is present in every Brazilian birthday party! Delicious and super easy to make.

## Ingredients:

- One can of condensed milk.
- Three or four spoons of chocolate powder or cocoa powder.
- One spoon of butter (actual butter pls, no margerine!)

## Instructions: 
1. Add all the ingredients into a pan
2. Put it under low heat and stir it (preferably with a wooden spoon) it until it starts sticking to the bottom of the pan
3. Remove it from the pan and eat it with a spoon or wait for it to cool down and roll it into small balls!

## Closing remarks:
Depending on how much brigadeiro you want to do, you'll have to add more or less of each ingredient, so be creative! Be careful with the chocolate powder, you definitely do not want to add too much of it!
