# Cacio e Pepe

![pepe](pix/cacio-e-pepe.webp)

Cacio e Pepe (meaning cheese and pepper) is not only based but also incredibly simple, ideal for lazy neets and similarly minded people who don't want to wash too many dishes and don't like complicated recipes with too many extra ingredients.

## Ingredients

- Spaghetti (recipe works with pretty much any type)
- Grated Parmasean Cheese (or something similar, pic above uses parmasean and fresh mozzarella)
- Grated Parmesan Cheese (or something similar)

## Directions

1. Cook your chosen amount of spaghetti 1-2 minutes under the time on the package
according to the directions on the package or however you usually do it.
2. Discard most of the water, leaving about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water in with the pasta (it depends on how much pasta you're making)
3. On medium heat, add the grated Parmesan cheese and stir everything so that the cheese melts and evenly coats the pasta.
How much cheese you need depends on how much spaghetti you're cooking. If it doesn't taste cheesy enough, add more on top at the end.
4. After 1 minute or so on medium heat, the pasta water and cheese will combine to form a creamy sauce.
5. Top with more cheese if you need, then add black pepper and salt according to your taste.
Pasta water and the cheese are already salty, so you may not need to add any extra salt.
6. It's done!
