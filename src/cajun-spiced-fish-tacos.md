## Ingredients
- cajun
- cayenne pepper
- white fish
- vegetable oil
- flour tortilla
- avocado
- little gem lettuce
- spring onion
- salsa
- sour cream
- lemon
- garlic

## Directions
1. Cooking in a cajun spice and cayenne pepper marinade makes this fish super succulent and flavoursome. Top with a zesty dressing and serve in a tortilla for a quick, fuss-free main that's delightfully summery
2. On a large plate, mix the cajun spice and cayenne pepper with a little seasoning and use to coat the fish all over
3. Heat a little oil in a frying pan, add in the fish and cook over a medium heat until golden. Reduce the heat and continue frying until the fish is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Cook in batches if you donâ€™t have enough room in the pan
4. Meanwhile, prepare the dressing by combining all the ingredients with a little seasoning
5. Soften the tortillas by heating in the microwave for 5-10 seconds. Pile high with the avocado, lettuce and spring onion, add a spoonful of salsa, top with large flakes of fish and drizzle over the dressing.
