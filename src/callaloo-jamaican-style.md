5. Add tomatoes; scotch bonnet pepper, smoked paprika. Saut√© for about 2-3 more minutes
6. Finally add vegetable, salt, mix well, and steamed for about 6-8 minutes or until leaves are tender. Add a tiny bit of water as needed. Adjust seasonings and turn off the heat
7. Using a sharp knife cut both ends off the plantain. This will make it easy to grab the skin of the plantains. Slit a shallow line down the long seam of the plantain; peel only as deep as the peel. Remove plantain peel by pulling it back

10. Let the plantains "fry" on medium heat, shaking the frying pan to redistribute them every few minutes
11. As the plantains brown, continue to add more cooking oil spray, salt and pepper (if needed) until they have reached the desired color and texture
12. Remove and serve with kale
