# Whole egg spaghetti carbonara

Alternative to the [other carbonara recipe](carbonade.html) that uses the whole egg and some slightly different methods.
I'm lead to believe the garlic element of this recipe makes it non-traditional but it tastes good and is hard to screw up.

## Ingredients

- Pancetta: 100g
- Pecorino Cheese: 50g
- Parmesan Cheese: 50g
- Large Eggs: 3
- Spaghetti: 350g
- Garlic: 2 cloves
- Unsalted butter: 50g

## Directions

1. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil
2. Finely chop pancetta (removing the rind). Finely grate and mix the cheeses.
3. Beat the eggs in a large bowl and season with a little pepper.
4. Add 1 tsp of salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti, and when the water comes back to boil cover the pan and bring the water to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes or until al dente.
5. While the spaghetti is cooking squash the garlic with the blade of a knife to bruise it.
6. Melt the butter in a large frying pan or wok, and then add the pancetta and garlic.
7. Cook the pancetta on a medium heat stirring often, for about 5 minutes until it is golden and crisp.
8. Once the pancetta is done remove the garlic and discard it, and then put the heat on low.
9. When the spaghetti is done tranfer it to the pan using tongs. Don't worry about drops of water in the pan you want that to happen. Don't throw away the pasta water yet.
10. Mix the eggs with more of the cheese, keeping a handful aside for sprinkling on the finish dish.
11. Take the pan off the heat. Then quickly pour the eggs and cheese in, and lift the spaghetti with tongs so that the eggs mix with the pasta and thickens rather than scramble.
12. Add some extra pasta water to make it saucier (you want it moist not wet). Season with a little salt if needed.
13. Now serve with a little sprinkling of the cheese and some pepper. If it goes a little dry before serving add some more pasta water.
