# Carbonara

![carbonara](pix/carbonara.webp)

Carbonara is a simple dish. The quality of your ingredients make or break it.
I recommend using the best ingredients you can source.
Suggestions: bronze extruded pasta, 24 months aged Parmigiano-Reggiano, 12+ months aged Pecorino Romano, guanciale from the butcher, and organic eggs.

This recipe assumes large eggs (63 g | 2 1/4 oz).

## Ingredients

- Spaghetti or linguine: 100 g | 3 1/2 oz pp.
- Eggs: 1
- Guanciale (cleaned and cubed): 60 g | 2 oz pp.
- Sausage: 1 (optional)
- Parmigiano-Reggiano (grated)(optional)
- Pecorino Romano (grated)(optional)

## Directions

1. Crack the eggs in a bowl. Add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper and optionally a dash of whole milk.
2. Fill a pot with water, and when it boils cook the pasta 1 minute less than advised. Use less salt than you would normally too.
3. Fry the guanciale in a dry pan on low to medium heat until the sides are crisp but the insides are chewy. Optionally you can open a sausage and put the insides together with guanciale. See the proportions though.
4. While everything is being cooked and fried, beat the eggs manually using a fork until everything is entirely liquid. Remember to watch the time.
5. When your pasta is done (-1 minute), drain it and put it in the bowl with eggs. At this step you may consider the timing: if the pasta is too hot you will cook the eggs, and some people don't like it this way, so just wait for a minute. Keep moving and stirring to fully incorporate the eggs. Add guanciale and as many fats remaining in the pan as you want. Keep moving and stirring.
6. Plate and optionally garnish with grated cheese and freshly ground black pepper. Voila.
