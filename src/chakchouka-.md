## Ingredients
- Tomatoes
- Olive Oil
- Onion
- Red Pepper
- Green Pepper
- Garlic
- Cumin
- Paprika
- Salt
- Chili Powder
- Eggs

## Directions
1. In a large cast iron skillet or sauté pan with a lid, heat oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until softened. 
2. Add the peppers and garlic, and sauté for an additional 3-5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, cumin, paprika, salt, and chili powder. Mix well and bring the mixture to a simmer.
3. Reduce the heat to medium low and continue to simmer, uncovered, 10-15 minutes until the mixture has thickened to your desired consistency. (Taste the sauce at this point and adjust for salt and spice, as desired.)
4. Using the back of a spoon, make four craters in the mixture, large enough to hold an egg. 
5. Crack one egg into each of the craters. Cover the skillet and simmer for 5-7 minutes, until the eggs have set. 
6. Serve immediately with crusty bread or pita.
