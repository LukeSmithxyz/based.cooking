# Easy Chicken Jambalaya

## Description
A simple Jambalaya recipe that can be made in about 50 minutes, with supplemental instructions on how to make Louisiana-style smoked sausage.
If you prefer pork to chicken, you may freely substitute the chicken for pork, rabbit, or so on.
Alternatively to chicken breast, you may instead substitute for a whole chicken, though the meat must be cut in a specific way which is not mentioned here.
You may cut down on the meat, otherwise the spices and vegetables should stay the same.
A basic knowledge of unit conversion is assumed—all here are U.S. Customary.

## Ingredients

- 1-1/2 lb. — Cajun sausage (plain or andouille, or substitute for 2 lb. ground pork)
- 2 lb. — chicken (raw, boneless, skinless chicken breast)
- 1 c. — shrimp (optional)
- 2 — 11"+ celery stalks (or 1-1/2 tsp. celery seed)
- 1 — yellow onion
- 3-5 — cloves garlic (minced)
- 2 — beef steak tomatoes (diced, or 1 can Rotel and 1 can diced vegetables, or 1/2 can tomato sauce)
- 1 — green bell pepper (or 1/2 green and 1/2 red)
- 2-1/2 c. — long grain rice
- 2 — mint leaves (or 1 drop mint extract) (optional)
- 1 tsp. — turmeric (optional)
- 1 tsp. — garlic powder (optional)
- 1 tsp. — chili powder
- 1-1/2 tsp. — cayenne powder (or 1 tsp. chili powder)
- 2 tbs. — salt (sea salt preferred)
- 1 tbs. — parsley (or fresh shredded parsley)
- 1/4 c. — vegetable oil (prefer to use butter or ghi)
- 2 c. — chicken stock (optional, substitute with water and salt)
- 4 c. — water (estimate)
- Cajun sausage is not like Italian sausage.  If none is available and you are unable to stuff your own, the following should roughly simulate smoked sausage:
	1. Take 2 lb ground pork and combine with
		- 1-2 tbs. cayenne (or red pepper flakes) (adjust to preference);
		- 1/2-1 tbs. finely ground black pepper;
		- 1 tbs. salt;
		- 1-2 tsp. white or brown sugar; and
		- 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke (hickory) (adjust to taste) 
	2. Slightly pan fry (no added oil) leaving fairly large chunks.  Meat should be about half cooked (still raw) and light-light brown, still a bit pink).

## Directions
1. Set oil in large pot on med. heat (if using butter, keep at medium to sautée vegetables) and thaw meats in microwave
2. Chop celery, place in oil; then dice bell pepper, place in oil; then dice onion and place in oil. (If using celery seed, put bell pepper first).
3. Turn fire to medium and stir in only the garlic powder, parsley, and turmeric; you will sautée for roughly 7-10 min.
4. In the mean time, cube the chicken breasts and cut the two links of sausage into small wheels. If you have no sausage, then prepare the meat roughly as to above—it should not be too spicy (if you so desire) and should appear to be rather flavourless, but not.
6. Before putting the meat in, rinse rice four or so times in a large, microwave save bowl.
7. After about 7 minutes, toss in the cubed chicken and sausage wheels (our ground meat), and toss in all spices save for the minced garlic, salt, and mint. Turn fire to medium high (7-ish) and cover pot, stirring occasionally. You are cooking meat completely.
8. While the meat is cooking pour 1 c. chicken broth into rice and coven rice with an 1/2-2/3 inch of water and microwave about 15 min. on high,.
9. The meat should be done enough after about 7 min. on medium-high, add in rest of chicken broth, tomatoes + juice, 1 cup of water, mint, minced garlic, and salt, stirring. Optionally, you may add a teaspoon of lemon juice and/or honey (mandatory if using olive oil).
   Cover and stir as necessary.
10. When rice is finished, turn jambalaya down to simmering (2-3) and stir in rice well, pulling off of burner.  If you want to add shrimp, do so now.  You may need to add a 1/2 a cup or so of water.  Cover and let simmer about 10 min. or until rice is done.
11. Once done, there should be little if any juice left.
