# Chorizo and Sweet Potato Enchiladas

Very filling with a sweet and spicy flavour.

## Ingredients

- 1 large sweet potato (approx 1 pound)
- 1 bell pepper
- 1 jalapenos (adjust based on spice preference)
- 2 cloves garlic
- vegetable oil
- 3/4 pounds chorizo (mexican chorizo is preferred)
- 8 flour tortillas
- 1.5 cups grated cheddar or other cheese
- 4 green onions
- enchilada sauce:
	- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
	- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
	- 2 tbsp chili powder
	- 2 cups water
	- 3 oz. tomato paste
	- 1/2 tsp cumin
	- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
	- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
	- salt to taste

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C)
2. Peel the sweet potato and cut into approximately 1/4 inch sized pieces. Remove the stem and seeds from the pepper and cut into approximately 1/4 inch sized pieces. Finely slice the jalapeno(s) and mince the garlic.
3. Sauté the sweet potato and garlic until the sweet potato has softened a bit then add the pepper and chorizo. Simmer until the meat is cooked through and the vegetables have softened. If using Spanish (cured) chorizo it will not need as much cooking time.
4. As the filling cooks, prepare the sauce. Add the oil, flour and chili powder to a saucepan and whisk together over a medium heat until the mixture begins to bubble. Continue to whisk and cook the mixture for a minute once it begins to bubble.
5. Whisk in the water and the spices and allow the sauce to simmer. Add salt to taste, typically 1/2 tsp to 3/4 tsp.
6. Oil a large baking dish or spray with cooking spray to prevent sticking. Scoop filling into tortillas then roll up into cigar shapes and place in the dish, seam side down. They should fit against each other tightly to prevent unrolling during cooking.
7. Pour the sauce over the top then top with the cheese evenly. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes and top with chopped green onions before serving immediately.
