## Ingredients

- Butter 50g
- Vanilla-extract 1/2 Tsp
- Flour 250g ( it should be from an unopened fresh bag so liquid absorption is well permitted )
- Bicarbonate-of-soda (baking soda) 1 Tsp
- Sunflower oil 1 litre!
- Bread chunks ( for testing oil heat only )

For the Sauce:
- Dark chocolate, broken into chunks 200g
- Double Cream 100ml
- Milk 100ml
- Golden Syrup 3 TBsp
- Vanilla Extract 1/2 Tsp

For the Cinnamon-sugar:
- Caster sugar 100g
- Cinnamon 2 Tsp

## Directions

1. Melt the butter.
2. Boil kettle (use stove if kettless), measure 300ml of the boiling water into a jug.
3. Add butter to jug, along with Vanilla-extract.
4. Sift flour and baking-soda into a large bowl with a pinch of Salt. Make a well in the centre, then pour the contents of the jug into it and very swiftly beat the flour until there are no lumps. Let rest for 10-15 min while you make the sauce.
5. Put all the sauce ingredients into a pan gently melt together, stirring, until you have a smooth shiny sauce, keep warm on low heat.
6. Fill a large saucepan/wok so it is 1/3 full of oil. Gently heat for a time on a low heat until brought to such a temperature that a chunk of break browns in the oil within 45s-1min; you should maintain this temperature and therefore may need to lower slightly to prevent heat passing over threshold during frying in the next steps.
7. Mix the caster sugar and cinnamon.
8. Obtain a piping bag, attach a 'star' nozzle 1-2cm wide. Fill with your dough after it has rested.
9. Pipe 2-3 strips into pan/wok. Fry until golden brown. Exercise extreme caution, if air bubbles form in the Churros they can explode. This risk is aggravated by unfresh flour and too hot oil.
10. Remove Golden brown Churros, drain on a kitchen paper lined tray.
11. Cover with Cinnamon-sugar, serve with sauce for dipping.
