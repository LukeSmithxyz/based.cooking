# Cold Brew Coffee

Delicious, high-caffeine, cold drink. Great way to make use of old or
cheap beans. Many like it better than iced hot-brewed coffee.

## Ingredients

Means to filter the coffee, like a french press or a plastic cone with paper filters.

- Some cups of dark roast coffee grounds, medium to large coarseness
- Water, 2-10x as much as the coffee
- flat or whipped heavy cream (optional)

Too finely ground beans will make it taste bitter.

## Directions

1. Measure coffee out into a bowl with a cup.
2. Measure water out with that cup. 1:2 to 1:10 coffee:water ratios are acceptable.
3. Mix cofee and water gently with a spoon.
4. Leave out for 12-20 hours.  Leaving it out too long will make it taste bitter.
5. Stir it after the first few hours (optional)
6. Filter the beans and refrigerate
7. Try it. If it is too concentrated, like syrup, add water.
8. Drink it cold.
9. Add whipped or flat cream if you want. Don't add sugar, it should be sweet enough.
