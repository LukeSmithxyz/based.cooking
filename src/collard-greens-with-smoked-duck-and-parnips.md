# Collard Greens with Smoked Duck and Parsnips

<<<<<<< HEAD
This dish was a pandemic leftover invention loosely inspired by Ethiopian gomen. It can be served as a side dish, but we eat it an an entree. If you intend it as a side dish, then this serves 4. The smoked duck adds a bit of saltiness, so it is better to season to taste after cooking. Serve with good quality, crusty bread.
