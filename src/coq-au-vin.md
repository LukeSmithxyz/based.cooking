- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 20 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 90 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 6

## Ingredients

- 1 Large Onion (or a bunch of Pearl Onions)
- 6 Bone-in Skin-on Chicken Thighs
- Some mushrooms (roughly same amount as onion by volume)
- 1 Cup (235ml) of dissolved Chicken Stock
- Garlic (optional)
- 1/3 of a bottle of Red Wine
- Lardons (Sliced Pork), could be any of:
    - Bacon
    - Pancetta
    - Salt Pork
- Herbs (Rosemary, Thyme, Herbs de Provence)
- 1-2 tsp. of Flour 

## Directions

1. Place your lardons in a cold pan, slowly cook them on medium heat. Remove them from the pan once they start to brown.
2. Place the Chicken thighs skin down in the pan and brown them on medium-high heat. You want the pan to be crowded so that the fond does not burn. Remove them from the pan once the skins are done.
3. Brown your onions and mushrooms on medium heat.
4. Add your flour and a little butter to make a light roux. If you're using garlic add it now.
5. Add the wine and herbs and deglaze.  Put the thighs and lardons back in the pan. Bring to a simmer while you preheat your oven to 375¬∞F/190¬∞C. 
6. Bake for 1 hour. If you are serving this with egg noodles (the traditional side) or [mashed-potatoes](creamy-mashed-potatoes.html) you should make them now.
7. Remove the thighs from the pan and put them on your final serving dish. Reduce the sauce to your desired thickness.

### A Note about Salt

Depending on how salty your lardons and stock are you might not want to add any salt at all to this recipe. When making this with pancetta and a cheap chicken stock (which tend to be very salty) the final dish turned out perfectly seasoned. You should wait until the very end to taste for seasoning.
