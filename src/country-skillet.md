# Country Breakfast Skillet

![Country Breakfast Skillet](pix/country-skillet.webp)

If you are feeling quite hungry after just waking up and want to have a
breakfast to fill your HP and stamina bars for the day, I've got just the
perfect recipe for you.

To be honest, this is more of a build-your-own dish. What I am providing here, I
would say, is more of a starting point and you're more than welcome to add (or
remove) anything you'd like. I also have to say that this is not exclusively a
breakfast dish, I've had it for breakfast, for lunch, for supper, for dinner,
etc. Although, I guess when you're a student just any food at any time of the
day will do.

## Ingredients

Since I more often than not cook this only for myself, the ingredient list below
is calculated for one person. Once more, this is not a strict ingredient list,
so you can really add anything you want. I would say that the only ingredients
that are a most are the eggs and the potatoes. The rest of the ingredients I
will mark with * for the ones that I usually use, and ** for ingredients that I
have used, but seldom use.

* 2 eggs
* 2 small/medium-sized potatoes
* Salt
* Black pepper
* 4-6 bacon strips*
* ½ an onion*
* Cheese (I usually use Gouda)*
* Paprika*
* A couple of Champignon 'shrooms**
* Some slices of bell pepper**

## Directions

1. Cut the bacon into pieces and fry it on a pan.
2. Cut the potatoes into small cubes.
3. After frying the bacon, set aside and use the bacon grease to fry the
   potatoes over medium/medium-low heat for about 20 minutes.
4. Add some salt and paprika to the potatoes, mix well and cook for another ten
   minutes.
5. Cut the onions and add them to the frying pan. Cook for about five minutes.
6. If you decide to add some vegetables, like mushrooms or peppers, add them
   now.
7. Now, there are two ways you can cook the eggs.*
    * Beat the eggs in a bowl and the pour them onto the pan.
    * Or just crack the eggs directly on the mix in the pan and mix everything
      thoroughly.
8. Cut the cheese into small slices and add it.
9. Cook for a couple of minutes more, until eggs are cooked enough. Don't let
   the eggs dry (unless that's the way you like your eggs ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯).
10. For the final touch, chop the parsley (or whatever other spices/herbs you
   decided to use) and add it on top.
11. Serve hot and add some freshly ground pepper.

\*Personally, I prefer to beat the eggs first in a bowl before adding them to the
frying pan.
