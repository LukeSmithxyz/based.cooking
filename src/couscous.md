# Traditional North African Couscous with Tomato sauce

This is the recipe for traditional couscous with tomato sauce, for this you might need a 5L pressure cooker or you can add less ingredients to fit in your cooker

## Ingredients

- Beef, sheep, Goat or chicken will work you can also have two or more types of meat if you want
- half an Onion (Preferably red Onion)
- 2 big spoons of concentrated tomato paste
- 2 magda zucchinis
- 2 white Potatoes
- 1 eggplant (optional)
- 1/4 green Cabbage (optional but makes it taste great)
- the amount of pumpkin you add highly depends on how many vegetables you've already added
- hot pepper / hot paste (very optional as it changes the taste of the sauce dramatically)
- I personally like to add some white radish to it but it's completely optional
- some salt, black pepper, some oil, around 3 to 4 littres of water (in freedom units this equates to around a galon)
- 1kg of couscous

this can feed up to 8 people

## Directions

for best results us sunflower seed oil

1. rap the onion
2. put some oil in your pressure cooker (make sure the heat is low or medium so you don't burn everything)
3. put the meat, the salt and black pepper the 2 spoons of tomato paste and the rapped onion and the hotpaste or hot pepper if you're going to add that and using a spoon mix them around for a minute
4. give it a minute before adding your vegitables and make sure to cut your vegitables by height if you're not sure look up couscous on your search engine to see how the images show the vegitables are cut
5. put some water until everytrhing is submerged and when it's submerged add around another 250-500ml of water because some of the water will evaporate so that the sauce isn't too concentrated this will need around 2 to 4 hours to fully cook
6. close your pressure cooker and crank the heat up (or leave it at medium but this will make it take a little longer)
7. while the sauce is cooking let's prepare the couscous itself, get a pot fill it with around 4 litres of water and put it on high heat.
8. get the couscous put it in a plastic container (or any countainer) and add some water and mix it well
9. put the couscous in the steamer and put that on top of the pot and don't close the steamer on top unless you're cooking a small amount
10. after 30 minutes take the steamer with the couscous in it and pour it into a container it's going to be hot but use your hands carefully to move the couscous around in the container (or use a spoon) to make sure it doesn't stick together while also adding a little bit of cold water to it make sure to add only a very small a mount of water
11. put the couscous back into the steamer and put the steamer on the pot.
12. repeat step 10 and 11, every 30 minutes for four times
13. after you cook the couscous add some butter to it and mix it (this step will make sure it doesn't stick together when it gets cold)
14. after 2-3 hours of cooking check the meat in the sauce if the meat is cooked then everything is also cooked, and if the sauce is too watery leave your pressure cooker on the stove without the cover for a few minutes on full heat to get rid of excess water.
15. bon apetit

and if you have leftover couscous you can buy some dates and resteam the couscous with the unpitted dates for around 30 minutes and eat it with some buttermilk (of cours this assumes you don't have any leftover sauce )
