## Directions
1. Crust: make a dough from 250g flour (I like mixing different flours like plain and wholegrain spelt flour), 125g butter, 1 egg and a pinch of salt, press it into a tart form and place it in the fridge. 
2. Filling: stir 300g cream cheese and 100ml milk until smooth, add in 3 eggs, 100g grated parmesan cheese and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. 
3. Take the crust out of the fridge and prick the bottom with a fork. 
4. Pour in the filling and bake at 175 degrees C for about 25 minutes. 
5. Cover the tart with some aluminium foil after half the time. In the mean time, slice about 350g mini tomatoes. 
6. In a small pan heat 3tbsp olive oil, 3tbsp white vinegar, 1 tbsp honey, salt and pepper and combine well. 
7. Pour over the tomato slices and mix well. 
8. With a spoon, place the tomato slices on the tart, avoiding too much liquid on it. 
9. Decorate with basil leaves and enjoy
