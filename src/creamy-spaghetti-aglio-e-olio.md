- üç≥ Cook time: 15 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 1

## Ingredients

- 57 grams of Linguine spaghetti
- 1/4 cup (60ml) extra virgin olive oil
- 2 cloves of garlic
- One fresh red chili pepper
- A bunch of fresh parsley
- Two eggs
- Parmesan cheese (grated)

## Directions

1. Start by boiling water in a pan for the pasta to cook in. Add about 2-3 teaspoons of salt per liter of water.
2. Mince the garlic cloves and chop the parsley finely. Also chop the red chili pepper in small round chunks (keep the seeds if you like it spicy).
3. Add the eggs in a bowl with a teaspoon of parmesan cheese and whisk them with the eggs. (add ground pepper for taste)
4. Add the oil and garlic to a cold skillet or pan.
5. Put the pan on high heat and wait till the garlic start bubbling in the oil.
6. Now add most of the parsley and all of the chili peppers to the pan with the oil and the garlic and toss it around a bit.
7. Turn off the heat on the pan, let the flavours get into the oil.
8. When the pasta has finished cooking, drain it very quickly but don't let it get too dry.
9. Put the pan of oil back on medium heat.
10. Add the pasta to the pan where the oil and chili peppers are in and toss it around a bit.
11. Now add the eggs and parmesan mix to the pan and toss it around even more. You dont want the eggs to actually fully cook.
12. After 20-30 seconds get the pasta from the pan onto a plate.
13. Add a bit of parmesan cheese on top of the pasta, and some fresh parsley on top of that.
