Deep fried meat balls. 
You might replace the ham/chorizo with chicken if that is your desire.

## Ingredients

- Flour 75g
- 2 eggs
- Bread-crumbs (dried) 75g
- Sunflower oil

For the Filling:
- Vegetable oil 4 TBsp
- 1/2 leek

- Milk 325ml

5. Combine stock and milk into pot and heat until steaming but not boiling. Season with nutmeg.
6. Gradually add the milk stock into pan a few TBsp at a time, stirring constantly.
7. Once you've incorporated the milk stock continue to cook for about 10 min, until it thickens and leaves the sides of the pan when you stir.
8. Season to taste. Ensure it is extremely thick.
9. Smooth the mixture onto a baking tray, once it has stopped steaming cover with a cloth to prevent it drying out and leave to cool in fridge for one hour.
