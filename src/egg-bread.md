![Egg Bread](pix/egg-bread.webp)

Basic bread with whole egg for flavor and extra rise. Compatible with air-fryer.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è  Total time: 5 hours
- üç≥ Prep time: 30 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 115g white flour (all-purpose or bread-flour)
- 15g whole-wheat flour (can use same flour as main if you don't have whole-wheat)
- 1.5g dry yeast
- 2.5g salt
- 1 whole egg

## Directions

1. crack refrigerated egg in bowl on zeroed-out scale. This is `egg weight`
2. calculate the amount of water to add with: `amount to add = (78 - (0.75 * egg weight))` or use 35 if you are allergic to math
3. add room-temperature water until scale reads `amount to add + egg weight` or use 92g if you really hate math
4. add yeast and salt to bowl, mix well
5. mix white flour and whole-wheat flour in another bowl
6. add flour to the water/egg/yeast/salt bowl, and mix well
7. knead the dough for 3 minutes. Goal dough temperature = 78 F
8. put dough in bowl, and cover with plastic wrap, and allow to proof for 1 hour
9. [fold the dough](https://youtu.be/haQf0LLDZnc?t=327)
10. cover, proof another hour

Now, if baking in real oven:

1. preshape the dough and rest 20 minutes
2. final-shape the dough proof 2 hours in the baking tin
3. preheat oven to 350 F (no fan)
4. score the loaf by cutting the top with a razor blade
5. put ice cubes in a tray and place in oven for steam
6. bake bread at 350 for 30 minutes, or until it's done (depending on the actual performance of your oven)
7. allow to cool on cooling rack

Now, if baking in air fryer:

1. shape the dough kind of flat
2. line the air-fryer container with parchment paper
3. proof 2 hours 20 minutes in the parchment paper-lined air-fryer container
4. score the loaf by cutting the top with a razor blade
5. put in air fryer, set to 350 F and bake for 15 minutes
6. pull out, flip bread upside down (to allow bottom to cook properly), bake another 5 minutes at 350 F
7. allow to cool on cooling rack
