- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 40 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 100 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 8

## Ingredients

- 3.3lbs (1.5kg) of black eggplants
- 1.1lbs (500g) of fior di latte mozzarella cheese
- 1 Yellow onion
- Black pepper
- Fine salt
- 1/4 oz (35g) of coarse salt
- 6 cups (1.4L) of tomato puree
- 1.3 cups (150g) of Parmigiano Reggiano DOP cheese
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Several leaves of basil
- Peanut seed oil

## Directions

1. Start by washing and drying the eggplants.
2. Remove with a knife the stem.
3. Slice the eggplant lengthwise with a vegetable slicer, or alternatively with a knife, to obtain slices about 1/8' (4-5 mm) thick.
4. As you place the slices inside a colander, sprinkle them with a very small amount of coarse salt between the layers, well distributed (you can also use a little fine salt), continue this way until you finish it all.
5. On top of the eggplants, place a plate with a weight on it to let the eggplants purge the excess water and slightly bitter taste, leave it like this for at least 1 hour.
6. Rinse the slices well under running water, one by one if necessary, to remove the salt and pat them dry before use.
7. In the meantime, slice and cut the fiordilatte cheese into strips, after which you will have very small cubes. If you don't have another colander, you can place them on a very clean cloth.
8. For making the sauce, in a large saucepan pour a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and add the chopped onion, stir often so as not to burn it and let it brown for a couple of minutes.
9. Then add the tomato puree and a little water, the salt and let it simmer for 45 minutes. When finished cooking do not forget to add the basil leaves by hand.
10. Heat planty of peanut seed oil to around a temperature of 340¬∞F (170¬∞C).
11. Fry few slices of eggplant at a time for about 2-3 minutes and dry them with oil blotting paper: always proceed a little at a time so they do not darken.
12. Moving on to putting it all together. Cover the bottom of an 8x12" (20x30cm) baking dish with a little sauce, then make the first layer by arranging the eggplant slices horizontally.
13. Grate some black pepper, sprinkle with parmesan cheese and pour some cubes of fiordilatte cheese, distributing them evenly. And finally pour on a little more sauce.
14. Repeat the same procedure but each time invert the direction of the slices. Between layers, remember to press gently with the palms of your hands in order to compact them.
15. On the last layer pour the remaining tomato puree, the cubes of fiordilatte and parmesan cheese.
16. Now bake your eggplant parmigiana in a hot oven at 400¬∞F (200¬∞C) for 40 minutes. Once ready, let it cool a few minutes before serving.
