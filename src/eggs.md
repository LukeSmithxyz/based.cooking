# Eggs

Eggs are great. This page will contain all sorts of "basic" ways of having an
egg. Feel free to suggest more, as per the instructions on the
[homepage](index.html).

## Ingredients

- eggs
- butter
- cheese(optional)
- milk (optional)

## Directions

### Boiled eggs

1. Bring water to boil (about enough to cover the eggs when submerged).
2. Place eggs in water.
3. Keep heat high enough to keep a rolling boil, boil until desired consistency
   (about 5 or less minutes for soft boiled and very runny, 8 minutes for medium
   runny, 10+ for hard boiled).

Tip: if your eggs are cracking when you put them in boiling water, you might
improve your chances of them not doing so by first warming them up in warm water
for a few minutes beforehand.

### Sunny-side up

1. Heat up butter or oil on small pan.
2. Crack egg(s) into pan.
3. Cook on low heat for an evenly cooked white and runny yolk.
4. Serve seasoned with salt and pepper.

### Scrambled

1. Heat up butter or oil on pan.
2. Crack eggs into pan.
3. Start scrambling with wooden spatula.
4. Cook until desired dryness.
5. Season with salt and pepper.

### Scrambled and fluffy

1. Prepare as normal.
2. Crack eggs into pan and let them coagulate maybe twenty or thirty seconds before scrambling.
3. Use a rubber spatula to sort of scrape the egg towards the center of the pan.
You're pushing the cooked egg towards the center while letting the raw egg spill out to be cooked.
Give the egg a couple seconds to cook before pushing it back towards the center.
The more you scramble the less fluffy the egg will be.
4. Finish as normal.

Scrambled eggs are easy to customize. E.g. start by frying any of: onions, bits
of ham, mushrooms, chopped tomatoes, etc., before cracking the eggs in.

### Scrambled and fluffier

Scrambled eggs can be made fluffier, at the tradeoff of one more bowl to clean,
and a more homogenous scrambled egg.

1. Crack eggs into a bowl of appropriate size.
2. Whisk eggs. If you don't have (or want to use) a whisk,
use a fork and stir in a horizontal "rolling" motion to introduce air into the eggs.
Do this until the egg is mostly homogenous and somewhat bubbly. Avoid over whisking.
3. Optionally, add a splash of milk. This helps with expanding the eggs slightly.
4. Cook as per "Scrambled and fluffy".

### Over-easy

Over-easy eggs are similar to sunny-side up eggs, but ensure evenly cooked whites
while retaining runny yolks.

1. Heat up butter or oil on small pan.
2. Crack egg(s) into pan.
3. Cook on low heat until the white of the egg's bottom is opaque.
4. Release the egg from the pan by gently slipping a spatula under the opaque white.
If the white breaks and exposes the pan underneath it, take the spatula out and try again
a little later. Push hot oil under the egg to help with this.
5. Gently slip the spatula under the yolk and in one confident motion, flip the egg over.
Don't worry if the white ends up folding on itself, the important thing is that the white
around the yolk is cooked all around.
6. Cook until the egg can be released from the pan, as per step 4. Bubbling around the edges
will slow down when this is possible.
7. Season as desired.

Tips:

- Crack the egg close to the pan to prevent the yolk from breaking on impact.
- Cook on as low a heat possible. If the egg starts audibly sizzling, take it off heat immediately.
Unless you like your eggs crispy. You do you.
