[homepage](index.html).

## Ingredients

- eggs
- butter
- cheese(optional)
- milk (optional)

Basted eggs are the most based way to consoooome eggs. They are like
over-easy, like poached eggs, but without breaking the yolks or losing
the whites.

1. Heat up some water separately.
2. Break eggs into a buttered pan, let cook until the whites are cooked in place.
3. Pour a little drizzle of hot water into the egg pan.
4. Cover the egg pan, the steam will cook the top of the yolk and white.
5. Slide them onto a plate. Squeeze lemon, add hummus, salt and pepper,
   tabasco sauce or whatevery you like.

### Poached eggs

1. Boil water.
2. Break eggs into water.
3. gently stir with a large, deep spoon occasionally.
4. Remove eggs with the large, deep spoon.

### Omelette-style scrabeled eggs

1. Break eggs into a bowl.
2. Add heavy cream to the eggs or milk. Salt. Pepper. (optional).
3. Use a fork in a circular motion to beat them into oblivion.
4. Butter a pan.
5. Pour eggs into pan. Let them cook until it is mostly cooked through.
6. Flip the whole patty like a pancake.

### Boiled eggs

1. Bring water to boil (about enough to cover the eggs when submerged).
2. Place eggs in water.
3. Keep heat high enough to keep a rolling boil, boil until desired consistency
   (about 5 or less minutes for soft boiled and very runny, 8 minutes for medium
   runny, 10+ for hard boiled).

Tip: if your eggs are cracking when you put them in boiling water, you might
improve your chances of them not doing so by first warming them up in warm water
for a few minutes beforehand.

### Sunny-side up

1. Heat up butter or oil on small pan.
2. Crack egg(s) into pan.
3. Cook on low heat for an evenly cooked white and runny yolk.
4. Serve seasoned with salt and pepper.

### Scrambled

1. Heat up butter or oil on pan.
2. Crack eggs into pan.
3. Start scrambling with wooden spatula.
4. Cook until desired dryness.
5. Season with salt and pepper.

### Scrambled and fluffy

1. Prepare as normal.
2. Crack eggs into pan and let them coagulate maybe twenty or thirty seconds before scrambling.
3. Use a rubber spatula to sort of scrape the egg towards the center of the pan.
You're pushing the cooked egg towards the center while letting the raw egg spill out to be cooked.
Give the egg a couple seconds to cook before pushing it back towards the center.
The more you scramble the less fluffy the egg will be.
4. Finish as normal.

Scrambled eggs are easy to customize. E.g. start by frying any of: onions, bits
of ham, mushrooms, chopped tomatoes, etc., before cracking the eggs in.
