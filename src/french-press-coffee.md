# French Press Coffee

Coffee using a simple brewing method and metal filter.

## Ingredients

- Coarse ground coffee beans (so they don't go through the metal filter)
- Water
- French Press
- 3-5 tbsp coffee grounds per 10oz water

## Directions

1. Boil water.
2. Put beans in the press. 3-5 tbsp (18-30g) of coffee per 10oz water.
3. Pour in water.
4. 4 minute brew time.
5. Push down the filter to the bottom and pour immediately.

## Overly Complicated Directions

1. Boil water.
2. Pour water into the french press to warm it up for even
    brewing. Dump it out. Improves flavour.
3. Boil more water.
4. Let boiled water sit for 60 seconds so it is at about 90
   degrees Celsius. Improves flavour.
5. Put beans in the press. 3-5 tbsp (18-30g) of coffee per 10oz water.
6. "Bloom" the beans. Pour just enough water on them to get them evenly wet, and wait 30 seconds.
7. Pour in water.
8. Push down filter, then pull it up so it rests just below the water line.
9. 4 minute timer.
10. After 2 minutes, gently stir with a non-metal spoon (a metal spoon can shatter the press!).
11. Push down the filter with a firm and gradual pressure until it is slightly above the bottom.
12. Put extra hot coffee in a thermos or carafe for refills. Don't leave it in the press.
13. Enjoy hot coffee. Don't drink the grounds at the bottom of your cup or carafe.
