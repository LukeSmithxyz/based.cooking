# Specialty Grilled Cheese

![Specialty Grilled Cheese](pix/grilled-cheese.webp)

This recipe calls for pancetta in place of regular bacon.
I definitely recommend the pancetta, an Italian bacon, as it grills quickly and provides a bit of a different bacon flavor than our traditional bacon.
The sandwich is served with blackberry jam, which is perfect for dipping your sandwich in.

## Ingredients

Makes 6 sandwiches:

* 12 slices pancetta (or regular bacon)
* 12 slices sourdough bread
* 6 tablespoons butter, softened
* 6 slices Swiss cheese
* 6 slices aged cheddar cheese
* 6 slices Monterey jack cheese
* 1 (12 ounce) jar blackberry preserves

## Instructions

1. Heat large skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes until hot. Add pancetta and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until crispy. You may need to work in batches to cook all the pancetta. Drain on paper towels and set aside.
2. Heat sauté pan on medium heat for 3 minutes until warm. Lightly butter one side of each slice of bread.
3. Place one slice of bread in pan, buttered side down. Top with 1 slice of Swiss cheese, 1 slice of cheddar cheese, 2 slices of cooked pancetta, and 1 slice of Monterey jack cheese. Add remaining slices of bread, buttered side up.
4. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook sandwich for two minutes or until cheese begins to melt. Turn sandwich and cook for 1-2 more minutes until desired texture and color.
5. Repeat with remaining sandwiches.
6. Serve each sandwich with 2 ounces of blackberry preserves.
