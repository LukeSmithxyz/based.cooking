# Hangover Eggs

Whenever my friends back home would drink to excess, they'd wake up wanting something tasty. I made them what I call "Hangover Eggs". Whether
or not you're hungover, they're very delicious! I've recently been making them to gain weight, though you can alter the recipe to whatever
suits your lifestyle.

## Ingredients

- Tony Chachere's
- Green onions
- Olive oil
- Loaf of French Bread
- Eggs
- Tabasco
- Beer

## Directions

1. Bring a cast iron pan to medium-high heat and add a second or two of olive oil when things start to warm up.
2. While the pan heats up, use your hands and tear off pieces of bread that are roughly the size of your hand.
3. Make sure you have one piece of bread per egg you want to make. I've dabbled with the egg:bread ratios, and this seems to work.
4. Once the olive oil starts smelling a bit (or smoke comes off of it), crack in however many eggs you care to eat. Turn down the heat to medium.
5. Act fast! As the eggs start cooking, prepare a plate with two handfuls of chopped green onion and Tabasco.
6. After about four minutes (or when the tops of the eggs start to set), take out eggs and place on top of bed of onions & Tabasco.
7. Turn heat back to medium-high and add a touch more olive oil. Place pieces of bread in pan.
8. Every so often, move the pieces of bread around to soak up the oil.
9. When the bread is about to turn a good shade of golden-brown, add a generous sprinkle of Tony Chachere's to the plated eggs (on top of them).
10. Turn off the heat and move the pan off the burner. Take out bread pieces and place on the same plate as the eggs.
11. Serve with glass of ice-cold beer.

Ideally, you won't even need a fork! Simply use the bread to guide the eggs on top of each piece, break the yolk into the piece, and take a large
bite.
