## Ingredients

- Strong coffee
- heavy cream (optional)
- butter (optional)
- MCT Oil (very optional)

## Directions

1. Whip heavy cream in a bowl with a whisk so it is whipped cream.
2. Melt butter in a pot.
3. If you have a blender, put fats and coffee in it and mix.
4. If you don't have a blender, pour in other fats and coffee
   into the hot pot and stir vigorously.
4. Pour into a cup with whipped cream on top.
5. Drink immediately before the ingredients separate.

Do not add sugar. This is a full meal, consume it by itself.
