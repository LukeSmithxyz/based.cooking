# Kebab wrap

This recipe is made for a 30 cm diameter wrap, which is what I use.
If you use smaller wraps, scale 1:1 with diameter of the wrap (or guesstimate).
This recipe is around 700 kcal if you use 250 g of chicken as the meat.

## Ingredients

- 5 cm of cucumber
- 1/2 small tomato
- 30 cm diameter wrap
- 100g Greek yogurt
- 75 g tomato paste
- 2 Tbsp garlic powder (or 2 cloves)
- Herbs (dried or fresh)
- Hot sauce (optional)
- Pickled jalope√±os (optional)
- ca. 150 g salad
- ca. 125 grams of meat (or meat substitute), can be whatever you like. I like chicken. Double amount if you like it really meaty.

## Directions

1. Fry whatever meat you want to use on a pan. You can do all of the following steps while frying.
2. Prepare salad, and slice the tomato and the cucumber in half-circles
3. Red sauce: Mix tomato paste with some salt, pepper, and herbs. Add 3-4 Tbsp of water to make it more runny. Substitute some water with hot sauce if you like it spicier.
4. White sauce: Mix Greek yogurt with garlic powder, some salt, and pepper. Add 2-3 Tbsp of water to make it more runny. You can also use lemon juice if you
   like it that way.
5. Layer the salad, vegetables, and sauces on the wrap. Do not mix for more heterogenous taste experience.
6. Meat should be done by now. Cut it in thin slices and add as the last layer.
7. Try your best at wrapping the monster you just created.
