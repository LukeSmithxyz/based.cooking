# Meatball Soup (Gupta)

- Cook time: 45 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4-6

## Ingredients

I've included a recipe for bloat-free meatballs but you can use any other recipe. Just leave the meatballs raw.
You can also substitute the meatballs with e.g. beans or kebab.

### Meatballs

- 400g minced meat (1 pound)
- 1 egg (optional)
- Whatever spices you like

### Soup

- 2 onions
- 2-4 garlic cloves
- 1 tbsp. oil
- 2.5 dl rice (1 cup)
- 13 dl water (5 cups)
- 1 bouillon cube
- 3 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tbsp vinegar (optional)

## Directions

1. Make the meatballs: mix ingredients by hand and make balls. Leave uncooked for now.
2. Chrush and dice the garlic and dice the onions. Heat the oil in a cooking pot. Saut√© the onion and garlic for a few minutes.
3. Add the rice, water and bouillon cube. Boil for 10 minutes on medium heat. Mix periodically.
4. Add tomato paste and vinegar.
5. Add the meatballs in one at a time while carefully mixing. Boil for 15 minutes.
6. Season the soup as you like.
