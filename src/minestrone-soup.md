# Minestrone Soup

Good, simple, and based vegetable soup.  The following ingredients list is what I typically use for a good balance of vegetables and tomatoes/broth, but I recommend changing these to fit your preferences after cooking this for the first time.  All ingredients are presented in the order that they will be added to the pot.
