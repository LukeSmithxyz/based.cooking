## Notes

* It would be best if you could grind the flour yourself 
* If mixing with hands, make sure they are clean
* You can use all sorts of flours, wheat flours work great but feel free to experiment
* Clean the mixing bowl immediately with water, as it is easier to wash it before flour hardens
* Eat it within few days or it will go bad, as there are no chemicals to prolong its shelf life
* If it is too hard to eat after a few days, use it with soups and similar liquids
