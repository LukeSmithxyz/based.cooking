## Ingredients
- Mulukhiyah
- Onion

## Directions
1. Saute the onions in the 3-4 tablespoons olive oil
2. Add the beef cubes or the chicken cutlets, sear for 3-4 min on each side
3. Add 1 liter of water or just enough to cover the meat
4. Cook over medium heat until the meat is done (I usually do this in the pressure cooker and press them for 5 min)
5. Add the frozen mulukhyia and stir until it thaws completely and then comes to a boil
6. In another pan add the 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil and the cloves of garlic and cook over medium low heat until you can smell the garlic (donâ€™t brown it, it will become bitter)
7. Add the oil and garlic to the mulukhyia and lower the heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes
8. Add salt to taste
9. Serve with a generous amount of lemon juice
10. You can serve it with some short grain rice or some pita bread
