# Cocoa Cake - Murzynek

![Cocoa Cake - Murzynek](pix/murzynek.webp)

A simple cocoa/chocolate cake recipe. In Poland, we call this cake "a pickaninny" (in polish - murzynek). If you want to bake a bigger cake, scale up the ingredients properly, you might also want to increase baking time. Original recipe (provided to me by my girlfriend) had 1 cup of sugar in it and used oil instead of butter. But since i
prefer butter, and after testing - less sugar was still perfectly fine in terms of sweetness (also, do you want the beetus?). Hence this recipe.
