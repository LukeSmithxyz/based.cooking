# Onion Raitha (Indian Tzatziki)

Raitha is an yogurt-based Indian style sauce that goes great with rice dishes such as Pilau and Biriyani. It's quite similar to
a greek Tzatziki and is quick and quite easy to make. It's great especially with super spicy indian dishes as it
provides as a sweet and cooling effect.
