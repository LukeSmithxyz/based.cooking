Simple timeless pancake recipe with easy ratios and staple ingredients

## Ingredients (To serve one person - three or four pancakes)
- 1 Cup plain (wheat) flour
- 1 Cup full cream milk
- 1 Egg
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 heaped tablespoon salted butter
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

## Directions
1. Add flour, sugar and baking powder to a bowl, sifting them together
2. Melt butter and whisk together with egg and milk in a **separate** bowl
3. Combine egg, milk, butter mixture with your flour, sugar, baking powder mixture
4. Whisk until smooth, adding very small dashes of milk as you whisk until you achieve your desired batter viscosity
5. Leave whisked batter to sit for 10 minutes
6. Lightly butter a medium temperature frying pan/skillet
7. Pour batter on to pan surface, amount is accordant to your desired pancake size 
8. Flip pancake when uncooked side is adequately aerated - timing is roughly 90 seconds initial side, 60 seconds final side
9. Apply a small amount of butter to your pan between each pancake

## Important Notes
1. If your pancakes burn, your pan is too hot or you are flipping/removing too late
2. Baking powder, not soda. Baking powder is sodium bicarbonate with a raising agent added
3. You can add more salt (than is in the salted butter) or sugar to taste
4. Batter viscosity (amount of milk used) is personal preference, more milk equals runnier batter equals thinner, flatter pancake
5. Pork lard can be used in the place of butter for steps 6 and 9 if a crispy fried finish is desired, however butter is better than pork lard in terms of human health (according to Ray Peat) [1] [2]
6. If you do try pork lard, experiment with a higher temperature and shorter cook time per side
