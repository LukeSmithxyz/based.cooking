- Preheat the oven to 300°C, and place the marinated paneer cubes, with onion, capsicum, and tomato on the skewers. Let them grill in the oven using skewer support, by continuously flipping them every 5 minutes until the outer crust looks crispy enough.
- Start heating some oil in a pan to add some cardamom and cumin seeds. Let it heat until the flavour is transfused for about a minute or two.
- Now add chopped onions and tomatoes to the sautee. Add some shaved ginger and garlic paste and let it sauté until some raw flavour disappears.
- Add the tomato puree, dry fenugreek leaves, and let it cook for about 15 minutes.
- As the spice and tomato puree looks cooked, add some water to the mixture and let it cook more.

- Now add the grilled paneer, some chopped vegetables of choice, corn and stir the mixture well.
- One the added water seems to be evaporated, and the mixture looks a little thicker, turn off the heat and garnish with lemon juice, fresh coriander. (It can be served with bread of any preference.)
