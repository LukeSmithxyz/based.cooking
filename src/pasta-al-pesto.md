A traditional Ligurian dish.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 15 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 20 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 2 cloves of garlic, peeled
- 2 handfuls of fresh basil leaves
- Coarse sea salt
- 1 medium raw potato
- Two tablespoons of pine nuts
  - Alternatively, a similar quantity of shelled walnuts will do
- 250 grams of fresh Trofie pasta (recommended)
  - Alternatively, use dry Linguine or Trenette
- 6 tablespoons of freshly grated Pecorino cheese
  - The same amount of Parmesan cheese is also fine
- Olive oil

## Directions

1. Preferably using a stone or wooden mortar and pestle, grind the garlic
   together with the basil leaves, the nuts, and a generous pinch of coarse salt.
   1. Note: the salt crystals help with mincing.
   2. A food processor also works, but it is not necessarily as much fun.
2. Add the grated cheese.
3. Add olive oil until getting a creamy consistence. Set aside.
4. Slice the potato fairly thin.
5. Add the sliced potato to a pot of cold water (3 to four liters should do),
   and bring to a rolling boil.
   1. Note: the starch from the potato gives the dish a smooth, creamy texture.
6. Add a tablespoon of coarse salt to the boiling water.
7. Add the pasta. If you use fresh Trofie, be ready to drain the pasta in a
   colander as soon as it raises to the surface (3 to five minutes). If you are
   using dry pasta, cook until "al dente" before draining.
   In any case, keep about half a glass (1-2 decilitres) of the water in the
   pot.
8. Return the pasta from the colander to the pot, and mix with the pesto
   sauce.
9. Serve immediately.
