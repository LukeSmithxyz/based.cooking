## Directions

1. Heat up olive oil on saucepan.
2. Add and roast either diced or grated onion or crush and sliced garlic until translucent.
3. Add San Marzano tomatoes, include the liquids from the can if possible.
4. Simmer contents of the pan and crush the tomatoes on the pan with your instrument of choice.
5. Additionally add desired herbs.
