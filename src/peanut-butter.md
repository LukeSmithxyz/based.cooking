# Peanut Butter

- ⏲ Prep time: 5 min
- 🍳 Cook time: 10-12 min
- 🍽 Servings: 4

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. of raw pre-shelled peanuts

## Directions

1. Spread peanuts on a large baking sheet and roast in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for 10-12 minutes
2. While the peanuts are still hot remove any skins from them. This is best done by wrapping a few handfuls at a time in a dish towel and rolling them against each other for several seconds.
3. Put all your roasted and skinned peanuts in a food processor, add salt if desired, and chop until you have reached your desired thickness of peanut butter. (This may take a few minutes)
