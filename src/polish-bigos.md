![polish-bigos](pix/polish-bigos.webp)

Traditional Polish dish. Generally, there are as many recipes as there are families in Poland, so feel free to modify as you feel :)

- üç≥ Prep / Cook time: 2 - 3 h
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4

## Ingredients

- Sauerkraut: 1 kg
- Polish sausage: 200 g
- Pork meat (e.g. pork neck, pork loin): 300 - 400 g
- Onion: 1
- Vegetable oil: 2 spoons
- Dried plums: how much do you want (4 - 7 should be ok), you can use plum jam instead
- Dried mushrooms (optional): 30 g
- Dry red wine: a little (to pour)
- Allspice
- Bay leaf


## Directions

1. Dice pork and cut onion into small pieces.
2. Fry onion in oil in a large pot (the whole dish must fit there), then add pork and fry it too.
3. Pour one and half glasses of warm water with salt and pepper (not to much salt!).
4. Season with bay leaf and allspice. Add plums and mushroms if you have them. Mix it up.
5. Cook until most of the water has evaporated. (approx. 30 minutes).
6. Add drained sauerkraut. A bit water if it's too dry. Mix it up and cook for 15 minutes.
7. In the meantime, peel, slice and fry the sausage a bit.
8. Add sausage, pour the wine over, mix up and cook for 45 minutes. Remember to mix regularly. 
9. Now it's ready to eat. If you are not in a rush, the dish can wait 2-3 days (then it will be even better).
