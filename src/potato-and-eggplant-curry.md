# Potato and Eggplant (Aubergine) Curry

A simple and tasty curry that is easy to customise.

## Ingredients

- 1 large eggplant (Aubergine)
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 2 onions (finely sliced)
- 2 garlic cloves (crushed)
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 2 tsp turmeric
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 400ml can chopped tomatoes
- 400ml can coconut milk
- rice

### Optional extras
- Carrots
- Red Peppers (Capsicums)
- Paneer

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to approximately 200°C (392°F). 
2. Cut the Eggplant into 1 cm (1/3 in) slices and place on a tray. Cover with a layer of oil and bake for 20 minutes.
3. Cook the sliced onions with oil until soft on medium (about 5-6 minutes).
4. Add the garlic, garam masala, turmeric and ground coriander and allow to release aroma for a minute or two.
5. Tip in the canned tomatos and coconut milk. Add the Eggplant, and chunks of potato.
  - It is possible to add additional vegetables at this step. I have on occasion added carrots and red peppers (capsicums).
7. Cover and simmer for ~15-20 minutes. 
8. Boil 2 serves of rice
9. Remove the lid and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until reduced.
  - A nice optional addition at this point is Paneer.
10. Serve with the rice
