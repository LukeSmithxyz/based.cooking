# Pour Over Coffee

Quick and simple way to produce filtered coffee without a coffee
machine. Tastes good, I like it better than from a drip machine. Great
for backpacking, very lightweight.

- Coffee cone
- Paper filter
- Pot or kettle
- medium coarseness ground coffee beans

## Ingredients

- ~3 tbsp coffee grounds
- 10oz water

## Directions

1. Put filter in the cone, on top of a cup.
2. Put beans in filter. Do not skimp.
3. Boil water.
4. Slowly pour in the water in a small, smooth stream. Evenly wet the beans.
5. Keep filling to the brim, and maintain the water level there until there is no more.
6. Let it drain.
6. Put extra hot coffee in a thermos or carafe for refills.

Some people put the beans directly in the boiling water. Don't do this,
it will taste weak, burnt, and flat. However, if using a metal sieve
this is the only way to brew it.
