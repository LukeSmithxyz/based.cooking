# Pourover Coffee

Brew coffee in any conical brew device like a Chemex or V60. Coffee is best brewed 'manually' to achieve the most consistent brew possible. This is easily accomplished via various pourover methods. Ideally, a single or double serving of coffee is brewed at a time.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: ~2 min
- üç≥ Brew time: ~3.5 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings:  Variable
- Brew Ratio: 1g coffee:17g water (20g:340g for single 10oz. mug)

## Ingredients

- Whole bean coffee (avoid dark roasts)
- Water heated to between 91C-96C (gooseneck kettle preferable)
- Scale (decigram-capable preferable)
- Brewer (Chemex, V60, etc)
- Filter for your brewer of choice
- Timer

## Directions

1. Bring water to 92C. If you don't have a thermometer, boil water then let stand for ~2 minutes.
2. Weigh out coffee for desired serving size, generally using 0.2g over to account for grinder retention.
3. Once water is at temperature, insert filter into brewer and rinse thoroughly to remove papery taste & preheat the brewer.
4. Pour this rinse water into drinking vessel (if separate from brewer) to preheat it.
5. Grind coffee. For Chemex; grind medium-coarse (0.7-0.8&#956;m). For V60; grind medium (0.6-0.7&#956;m).
6. Add coffee to brewer, settle grounds into a flat bed. Tare your scale.
7. Start your timer, then pour evenly over the coffee bed up to 2X your coffee mass.
8. Wait 40s as coffee blooms and releases trapped gasses, primarily CO2.
9. At 40s, pour up to your brew mass (340g for single serving) by ~1min 10s in a steady flower pattern.
10. Wait for draindown. Brew time should be approximately 3.5min for Chemex, 3min for V60.
11. Dispose of spent coffee and filter, enjoy your coffee.
