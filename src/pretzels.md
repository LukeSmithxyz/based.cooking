# Traditional German Pretzels - Laugenbrezel

These pretzels require sodium hydroxide, commonly known as lye. This should be acquired as a food grade or otherwise verifiably pure product, not as drain cleaner. A 3% solution is not very strong, thus not particularly dangerous, however precautions must be taken to prevent prolonged skin contact and ingress of lye into your eyeballs.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 30-45 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 20-30 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 5

## Ingredients

- 500g white flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon honey or sugar
- 3.5g dry yeast (Half a package)
- 20 g soft butter
- 200-300 ml milk
- 100ml warm water
- 3% Sodium hydroxide aqueous solution

## Directions

1. Place flour in a large mixing bowl, create a well in the center and add the sugar, yeast, and water. Allow 5-10 mins for yeast to rehydrate.
2. Add salt, butter, and 200 ml of milk, mix to form a shaggy dough, adding milk sparingly as needed for ingredients to come together.
3. Remove from bowl, kneed on floured surface or machine kneed until smooth. Place dough back in mixing bowl, cover, and allow to rise until doubled.
4. Punch down dough and remove from bowl. Divide into approximately 8 equal pieces and shape as desired. These make great buns, rolls, sticks, and traditionaly shaped pretzels.
5. Place on parchment paper and let rise for 1-2 hours in a refridgerator. This helps form a skin, which will enhance the pretzeling effect. 
6. Preheat oven for 15+ mins on 350-400¬∞F (175-205¬∞C), depending on the size of your pretzels.
7. Prepare a 3% lye solution by mixing 30 grams with 1 liter of water in a large dish, I use a 9x9 glass baking dish.
8. Remove pretzels from fridge, dunk in sodium hydroxide solution for about 10 seconds on each side.
9. Return to parchment paper, garnish with a course salt, and make a 1‚Äù+ slash with a sharp knife or razor in each pretzel.
10. Bake for 20-30 mins or until done. Pretzel coating will bubble before it starts to burn.
