# Quesadilla

A quick and easy meal, able to be taken anywhere, but be warned of its high empty carb counts.

Serves 1.

Cooking time: ~5 minutes

## Ingredients

- ~ 1-2 tortillas. Any brand works, but you can decide if you want the tortilla folded in half, or double tortillas.
- ~ 4 small pinches of mozzarella or oaxaca cheese. Mozzarella is preffered, but the taste of oaxaca cheese is more authentic.
- ~ (Optional) A thin coating of oil on the pan. It will be more unhealthy, but will be (again) more traditional.
- ~ Any toppings you want. ie, veggies, chicken, mushrooms (cooked)

## Directions

1. Add oil to the cold pan if you have it.
2. Heat pan to medium.
3. Lay the tortilla(s) down on the pan until softened and lighty golden brown.
4. Add the cheese plus toppings to one half of the tortilla if using 1, add to the entire surface of one, if using 2.
5. Place the unused tortilla on top of the other one, if you have 2. If you have 1, fold the empty half over to the other side.
6. Wait and continuously check if cheese is melty.
7. Serve.
