This is a traditional Brazilian dessert that takes after the Portuguese sweet brisa-do-Lis, trading the almonds for coconut flakes.

- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 20

## Ingredients

- 14 sieved egg yokes
- 1 whole egg, sieve the yoke
- 100g of unsweetened grated coconut
- 100g of butter
- 200g of refined sugar
- Butter to grease the mold

## Directions

1. Grease the individual molds with butter and coat with a little sugar, set them aside.
2. Mix the sugar with the butter until homogeneous.
3. Add the grated coconut, the yolks, the whole egg and mix thoroughly.
4. Fill the molds to the top and set them aside for 1 hour so that the grated coconut floats on to the top.
5. Preheat the oven on maximum and leave it at 200¬∞C when putting the molds in.
6. The Quindins should be cooked with the molds in a shallow water bath, on the shelf closest to the fire.
7. When the grated coconut on top becomes a deep gold the Quindins are ready.
8. Remove the tray from the oven and with the help of a butter knife remove the Quindins from their individual molds while they are still hot so they don't stick to the molds.
9. Eat them hot or cold. They can be frozen for later consumption in individual containers sealed with plastic wrap.
