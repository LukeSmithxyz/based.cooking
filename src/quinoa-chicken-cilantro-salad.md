## Ingredients

- Chicken - Thighs will have more fat and are easier to cook, use a meat you prefer.
- Pack of bacon / bacon crumbles.
- 2 Bell Peppers
- 3-ish bunches of cilantro.
- 1 Lime.
- 1 bunch of scallions / green onions.
- 2-ish jalapenos. 
- Artichoke quarters.
- Pre-cooked or uncooked quinoa.
- Curry / Cumin
- Salt
- Pepper


## Directions

1. If you purchased pre-cooked quinoa skip this step, otherwise prepare quinoa according to package. I enjoy adding garlic powder and curry powder to my quinoa. 
2. Pre-heat oven to 360¬∞ F, bake chicken thighs for 30 minutes, adjust if needed.
3. Cook bacon to preferred crisp, chop into pieces. Or skip if using packaged bacon crumble. 
3. Chop the scallions, green onions, jalapenos (keep seeds for heat) and cilantro. Blend while squeezing in half of a lime (or to taste), add 3 tablespoons of mayo. 
4. Blend, salt, and increase heat to the cilantro dressing to taste.
5. Chop desired amount of spinach and cherry tomatoes. 
6. Add it all to a bowl and finish with a delicious dressing and artichokes!
