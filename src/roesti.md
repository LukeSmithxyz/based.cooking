# Rösti

Usually cooked to get rid of leftover potatoes from the day before.
This swiss classic works great together with fried eggs.

Serves: 1

Cooking time: ~45 minutes

## Ingredients

- ~500g (~1lb) potatoes (firm/waxy)
- 2 eggs
- 1 onion (medium size)
- butter

## Directions

1. If you don't have cooked potatoes from the day before: Cook them and let them cool. It is important to use cold potatoes.
2. Shred your potatoes with a grater. The shreds should be quite large so don't use your typical cheese shredder.
3. Dice the onion and mix together with potatoes. Add your seasonings here. The typical ones are of course salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
4. heat up some butter in a large pan. Add your mix to the pan on high heat. Let the mixture get warm for a few minutes under constant stirring.
5. reduce heat to medium-low. Form the Rösti into a puck. Depending on how soft you want it inside adjust the thickness. I recommend something around 1 - 1.5cm (~1/2") for a softer Rösti.
6. add some more butter flakes around the brim of the pan to get under the Rösti.
7. The browning process can take quite a while. Usually I'm not at the stove while it's cooking. Check after roughly 10-15 minutes for browning.
8. When you're satisfied with the achieved browning, flip the Rösti. A plate can be useful here to put on top of the Rösti in the pan.
9. When the Rösti crispness is to your liking, remove from pan and fry two eggs. A runny yolk adds quite a bit to the potatoes.
10. Top Rösti with eggs and serve.
