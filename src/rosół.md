## Ingredients
- Chicken Legs
- Onions
- Carrots
- Leek
- Celery
- Cabbage
- Cloves
- Allspice
- Bay Leaf
- Parsley
- Dill
- Pepper
- Salt

## Directions
1. Add chicken to a large Dutch oven or stock pot 
2. Cover with water
3. Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, skimming any impurities off the top to insure a clear broth
4. If your pot is big enough, add the vegetables and spices for the last hour of the cooking time
5. My Dutch oven wasn’t big enough to hold everything, just the chicken and other bones filled the pot, so I cooked the meat/bones for the full cooking time, then removed them, and cooked the vegetables and spices separately
6. Strain everything out of the broth
7. Bone the chicken, pulling the meat into large chunks
8. Slice the carrots
9. Return the chicken and carrots to the broth
10. Cook noodles according to package instructions if you’re using them
11. Add noodles to bowl and then top with hot soup
