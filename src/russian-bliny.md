# Russian Bliny

![Russian Bliny](pix/russian-bliny.webp)

A classic that has its many spins in different cuisines, including Russian
cuisine. Recently was the
[maslenitsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslenitsa), so as usual I decided to
prepare them. They can be filled with sweets or meat or basically any food.

## Ingredients

The following ingredients should yield about 15 bliny.

* 300—400g wheat flour
* 700—900ml milk
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 2—3 eggs
* 1 teaspoon olive oil or melted butter
* Butter
* Boiling water
* Sugar

## Directions

1. You should start by adding the flour to a bowl, then add the eggs, sugar and
   salt to taste, and baking soda.
2. Next add the milk carefully, so that the batter ends up liquid enough, but
   not too liquid. It should be more liquid than bread batter, but not too
   liquid so that it doesn't drip too fast.
3. Add a little bit of boiling water and oil or butter and mix the batter
   until it becomes homogeneous. If you feel it's too liquid, add a little bit of
   flour, if it's not liquid enough, then add a little bit more milk.
4. Heat up a frying pan to medium heat, cover with a thin layer of melted
   butter, you can use a paper napkin or towel for that.
5. Slowly pour the batter into the pan rotating it a little bit while you do this,
   such that you end up with a thin layer of batter that covers all the pan.
6. Cook until you see little bubbles or pores forming in the batter, then flip,
   and cook for another couple of minutes.
7. Once one blin is ready, remove it from the pan and put it on a plate. Spread
   some butter on its top.
8. Continue cooking the bliny, spreading butter on the pan with a paper
   napkin/towel once every 1-3 bliny, until you run out of batter.
