# Schinkenfleckerl überbacken, Viennese Mac'n'Cheese

* ⏲️ Prep time: 25 min
* 🍳 Cook time: 120 min
* 🍽️ Servings: 8-12

This is a recipe for a typical Austrian carb and protein bomber. This is traditionally made with ham or smoked rolled roast. This is good if you want to feed a family or if you just want to be lazy and eat the same thing for 3 or 4 days.

Serve topped with cheese on top of salad (with Mustard, Jam, Salt, 1 Vinegar, 4 Oil-Vinegrette)

## Ingredients

- 1kg ham or smoked rolled roast
- 1kg cooked fusilli noodles or small square flat noodles (=Fleckerl)
- 500 ml cream
- 500 ml sour cream
- 1-2 eggs
- Majoran, Muskat, Pepper
- Optional:
  - parmesan
  - chili flakes

## Directions

1. Start cooking noodles.
2. First slice, then cube ham into smaller than 1cm³ pieces.
3. Whip cream in a big bowl.
4. Add spices, eggs and sour cream to bowl and stir.
5. Put ham cubes in and stir.
6. Put noodles without water into bowl and mix.
7. Put the mixture into one or two baking pans (with baking paper).
8. Bake at ~160°C for ~2 hours.
9. Optionally gratin mozzarella or any other cheese on top for 5-10 minutes.

There you have it, an idiot-proof carb and protein bomber that should taste reasonably well. Besides browning the noodles this is really just throwing stuff into a baking pan. This is the kind of dish that tastes better the next day so it's ideal for making on a Sunday and eating for the next 3 or 4 days. Just reheat in oven or pan (add little water).
