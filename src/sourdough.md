# Sourdough

This is the standard framework for creating sourdough. You should have a dutch oven and a razor handy but it's not completely necessary. The Levain is a deposit of wild yeast that you naturally cultivate through regular feedings and care.

## Ingredients

### Levain

- 50g white flour
- 50g whole wheat flour
- 100g water

### Dough

- 800g white flour
- 200g whole wheat flour
- 750g water
- 200g levain
- 22g salt

## Directions

1. In a mason jar or plastic container, mix the Levain ingridients. With the same quantities, do this everyday for two weeks, or until the levain begins to show consistent volume and activity.
2. Mix the flours and water from the Dough ingridients in a bowl, and let rest for 30-60 minutes.
3. Add the salt and levain to the dough and mix thoroughly. 
4. Let dough ferment for 4-12 hours, you can adjust this depending on what fits your schedule. In the first 4 hours of the bulk fermentation, take a corner of the dough and fold it onto itself.
5. Dump the dough onto a countertop and divide the dough into two halves. Take each dough half, and wrap it onto itself into a ball. Let them rest on the counter for 15 - 20 minutes. 
6. Shape the bread. Take one dough ball, stretch it out on your countertop. Fold the dough together like a brochure. From the top working downwards, stitch the dough together and tightly interlock the seams. Roll the dough toward you to produce a ball. Do this for each dough ball.

7. Place the dough in the fridge for 12-48 hours, adjust this according to your schedule. 
8. When you're ready to bake, place a cast iron dutch oven in the oven and pre-heat it at 500f for at least 30 minutes. 
9. Place a single dough ball in the dutch oven. With a razor, slice the top of the dough at a 30 degree angle. Place the lid on the dutch and bake the loaf at 500f for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, remove the lid, and reduce the oven temperature to 450f, bake for another 25 minutes. Do this procedure for each dough ball.
