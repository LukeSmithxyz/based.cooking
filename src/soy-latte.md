# Soy Latte

A foamy, sweet, but not too sweet, Cinnamon Soy Latte is a favorite drink for lazy weekend mornings. Grab a big mug!..

- üç≥Cook time: 6 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 1

## Ingredients

- 10 oz. soy milk, original
- 1 shot of espresso
- coconut sugar, sweeten to taste
- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon

## Directions

1. Warm your milk until very hot. (You can even use your microwave.)
2. Pour the hot milk into a blender. Turn blender on lowest speed. Add the cinnamon and coconut sugar to taste ‚Äì a few teaspoons should do it. You can also use maple syrup, agave or honey. Blend for a minute on low, then thirty seconds at a higher speed. Turn off blender and let the frothy milk sit there for at least a minute. This allows the foam to form at the top.
3. Add espresso to the empty mug that you used to warm the milk.
4. Slowly pour the milk over top the espresso. Your milk may not all fit in the mug, since it increased in ‚Äòsize‚Äô from the foamy bits. You can scoop foam over top or pour the extra in a side cup and add it after a few sips.
5. Sprinkle coconut sugar over top to serve.
