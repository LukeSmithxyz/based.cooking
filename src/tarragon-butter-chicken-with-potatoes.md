inside.

8. Fry garlic for a minute on a high heat then add tarragon/pepper mix and add a fair amount of white wine.
9. Add the long green things, place the chicken on top of them, turn the heat right down and simmer for 10 minutes or so until the long green things turn soft.
10. Take out the chicken and long green things but keep the sauce in the frying pan.
11. Fry the potatoes in the sauce until they are crispy on the outside.
Serve.
