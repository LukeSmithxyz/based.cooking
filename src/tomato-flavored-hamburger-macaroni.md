3. Drop onion and the pepper into the pot with the hamburger.
4. Add all of the seasoning.
5. Keep cooking until all of the hamburger is brown.
6. Once done, find a place to put the pot and keep it warm while you cook the macaroni.
7. Cook the macaroni according to [this pasta recipe](pasta.html).
8. Dump either the macaroni into the hamburger pot or vice versa, the order doesn't really matter.
