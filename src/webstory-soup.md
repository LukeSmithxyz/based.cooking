this Soup combines lentil with one leek , onions , as well as a mixture of the spices Paprika and Sage to represent the blue-pill/red-pill dichotomy in life including the ancient history of those spices . I created the Soup to serve during viewings of Ghost in the Shell since the Sage gives the lentil a spooky halloween flavour . if you have ever seen a lentil plant , then you might know the thin stems holding the lentil pods look like spider webs . I set the portions mostly according to my own sense of posterity , so please feel free to adjust them to your own social context or Taste .

## Ingredients

1 Leek
4 Green Onions
4 table spoons of paprika
4 table spoons of sage
