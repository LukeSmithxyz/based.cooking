![Yorkshire Puddings](pix/yorkshire-puddings.webp)

Basically the northern England equivalent of the french pancake ( a means to make use of extra flour when you didn't have enough for bread ). They go well with Sunday Roasts.
Puddings may be preserved in freezer for up to a month.

1. Preheat oven to 230°C / gas mark 8.
